16,-3,-1,I think we've seen a deterioration of values.
18,-3,-1,"For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that's all wrong."
20,-3,-1,"We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing."
22,-3,-1,"And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction."
24,-3,-1,We've got to get after the users more.
25,-3,-1,We have to change this whole culture.
30,-3,-1,"Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education."
31,-3,-1,And it isn't a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem.
32,-3,-1,But we have got to instill values in these young people.
34,-3,-1,"But I think we're all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools."
36,-3,-1,I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.
38,-3,-1,That means those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership have to reflect those values ourselves.
39,-3,1,Here we are with a government that's been dealing with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.
41,-3,-1,Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.
42,-3,0,"I remember being in a high school in my own state as we were organizing something we call the Governor's Alliance Against Drugs, and a young 16 year old girl coming up to me, desperate, addicted, dependent, saying, Governor, I need help."
46,-3,-1,Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.
50,-3,-1,"I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention."
52,-3,-1,"But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you."
54,-3,-1,But we also have to take demand seriously.
55,-3,1,"You know, we have five percent of the world's population in this country."
56,1,1,We're consuming 50 percent of the world's cocaine.
57,-3,-1,Doing better in the neighborhoods.
60,-3,-1,I agree with Mr. Bush that values are important.
61,-3,-1,But it's important that our leaders demonstrate those values from the top.
65,-3,-1,Governors like me and others have been trying to deal with the consequences.
69,-3,-1,"Values begin at the top, in the White House."
70,-3,-1,Those are the values I want to bring to the presidency and to the White House beginning in January of 1989.
74,-3,-1,"I'm saying that those of us who are elected to positions of political leadership, Jim, have a special responsibility, not only to come up with programs, and I have outlined in detail the very important, very strong program of enforcement as well as drug education prevention."
76,-3,-1,"But if our government itself is doing business with people who we know are engaged in drug profiteering and drug trafficking, if we don't understand that that sends out a very, very bad message to our young people, it's a little difficult for me to understand just how we can reach out to that youngster that I talked about and to young people like her all over the country, and say to them we want to help you."
77,-3,1,"Now, I've outlined in great detail a program for being tough on enforcement at home and abroad, doubling the number of drug enforcement agents, having a hemispheric summit soon after the 20th of January when we bring our democratic neighbors and allies together here in this hemisphere and go to work together."
81,-3,1,And in my state I'm proud to say we've organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country.
82,-3,-1,We're helping youngsters; we're reaching out to them.
83,-3,-1,"And we're beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that's the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America."
84,-3,-1,"And we've got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances."
85,-3,-1,"I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country."
86,-3,-1,"If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don't pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country."
93,-3,1,It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice.
94,-3,1,"And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor - that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him."
95,-3,-1,And so I think it's about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective.
96,-3,-1,Panama is a friendly country.
97,-3,1,"I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him."
98,-3,-1,And we want to bring him to justice.
99,-3,-1,And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations.
105,-3,-1,"Yes, I've been very specific about those, John."
106,-3,1,"And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that's balanced ten budgets in a row, I've had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices."
107,-3,-1,"First, I've suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don't need and we can't afford."
112,-3,-1,"Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down."
115,-3,-1,I've also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts.
116,-3,1,"We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we've been doing under this administration."
117,-3,-1,"We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again."
119,-3,1,"He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he's against new taxes, although he's broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break."
120,-3,-1,He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs.
121,-3,-1,"If he keeps this up, he's going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics."
132,-3,-1,"There are so many things there, I don't quite know where to begin."
138,-3,-1,So that's one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us.
142,-3,-1,"And it permits - economists on the East Coast and West think it's good - it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes."
148,-3,-1,I think it's the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down.
153,-3,-1,I would like a balanced budget amendment.
154,-3,1,But the dynamics of the economy - we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years.
155,-3,-1,So the problem is - it's not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out - the woman working in some factory being taxed too little.
156,-3,-1,It is that we are continuing to spend too much.
158,-3,-1,Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending.
160,-3,-1,And if we - and the - actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending.
161,-3,1,Spending was only up something like 4 percent.
162,-3,-1,"So, it isn't that we're taking too little - from taxpayer - we're spending too much still."
163,-3,0,"And the formula I've given you works, we've put it through a good economic model, we've got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who's a very respected economist in the - Massachusetts."
164,-3,-1,"And they agree, that if we can do what I've said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again."
165,-3,-1,"Capital gains, one more point on that, please let's learn from history."
166,-3,-1,"A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government."
168,-3,-1,"Well, I hope all of those Americans out there who are watching us, listening to us and trying to make up their mind about which one of us ought to be president of the United States listen to the Vice President very carefully."
169,-3,1,"What he's proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we're going to give to people making $200,000 a year."
173,-3,-1,"It's time for a chief executive who can make tough choices, can work with the Congress, can get that deficit down and begin to build a strong fiscal foundation under this country."
180,-3,-1,I want to keep this economic recovery going.
181,-3,1,"More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force."
182,-3,-1,What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid.
183,-3,-1,I believe that's the answer.
185,-3,-1,And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we're talking about here.
186,-3,-1,But we've got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work.
187,-3,-1,"So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program."
188,-3,-1,"It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also - I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, ""We can't make it."""
189,-3,-1,And I think then you're going to see that people are put out of work.
192,-3,-1,It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete.
193,-3,-1,"So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system."
194,-3,-1,I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance.
195,-3,-1,I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience.
196,-3,-1,It's a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance.
197,-3,-1,But I just don't want to mandate it and risk putting this - setting the recovery back.
199,-3,-1,"But, George, that's no answer."
200,-3,-1,"You don't like the answer, but it's an answer."
201,-3,1,"Well, no, it's no answer to those 37 million people, most of them members of working families who don't have a dime of health insurance and don't know how to pay the bills if their kids get sick at night."
206,-3,1,My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state.
208,-3,-1,And I think it's time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance.
209,-3,-1,That's the way we're going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours.
217,-3,-1,Because has won the support of a great many people all over the state and I think it's a model for what I hope we can do across the country.
221,-3,-1,"Well, he was wrong then and he's wrong now."
226,-3,-1,Let me say this about AIDS.
229,-3,-1,And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it's appropriate and where it's done carefully and responsibly.
230,-3,-1,But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had.
231,-3,-1,"In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do."
233,-3,-1,I think we're both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor.
240,-3,-1,"Testing should be confidential, but we have to have a knowledge."
241,-3,-1,We can't simply stick our heads in the sands in terms of testing.
243,-3,-1,"And you got to be careful here, because there's a safety factor, but I think these things - and then also I am one who believes we've got to go the extra mile in clean - being sure that that blood supply is pure."
245,-3,-1,"So, research, speeding the drugs to market, testing, blood supply are very important elements of this."
259,-3,-1,"Well, I don't question his passion."
260,-3,-1,I question - and I don't question his concern about the war in Vietnam.
263,-3,-1,He - we have a big difference on issues.
265,-3,0,"He said, ""I am a strong liberal Democrat"" - August, '87."
268,-3,-1,He is out there on out of the mainstream.
271,-3,-1,And I wish we had time to let me explain.
272,-3,-1,But I salute him for his passion.
273,-3,-1,"We just have a big difference on where this country should be led, and in what direction it ought to go."
282,-3,-1,But just take a look at the positions of the ACLU.
283,-3,-1,"But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don't like it when I say that he says he's a card carrying member."
287,-3,-1,I simply don't want to see the ratings on movies.
289,-3,-1,I like those ratings systems.
290,-3,-1,I don't think they're right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church.
295,-3,-1,I don't agree with that.
296,-3,-1,I come from a different point.
297,-3,-1,And I think I'm more in touch with the mainstream of America.
301,-3,-1,I'm not questioning his patriotism.
303,-3,-1,And then all the liberal columnists join in.
305,-3,-1,"I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he's coming from He has every right to do it."
307,-3,-1,"And that's all I'm trying to do, is put it in focus."
308,-3,-1,And I hope people don't think that I'm questioning his patriotism when I say he used his words to describe his participation in that organization.
310,-3,-1,"Well, I hope this is the first and last time I have to say this."
311,-3,-1,"Of course, the vice president is questioning my patriotism."
312,-3,-1,"I don't think there's any question about that, and I resent it."
314,-3,0,My parents came to this country as immigrants.
326,-3,-1,"Not labels that we attach to each other, questions about each other's patriotism and loyalty."
334,-3,-1,I believe that that would help in terms of shelter.
335,-3,-1,"I want to see - when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help."
337,-3,0,"My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker's wife."
339,-3,-1,"These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves."
340,-3,-1,The government has a role.
343,-3,-1,And so I think that we're on the right track.
345,-3,-1,I see an involvement by a thousand points of light.
346,-3,-1,"I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill."
347,-3,-1,They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work.
348,-3,-1,And we're on the track on this one.
349,-3,-1,"But - and I, look, mental - that was a little overstated it."
350,-3,-1,I'd say around 30 percent.
351,-3,-1,And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out.
352,-3,-1,Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them.
353,-3,-1,Because there is a major problem there.
358,-3,1,"Well, this is another fundamental difference that I have with the vice president, just as I do in the case of health care for 37 million members of working families in this country who don't have health insurance."
359,-3,1,"The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you've cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income."
360,-3,-1,"And when you do that, you've have homeless families."
361,-3,1,"We didn't have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago."
362,-3,-1,We've got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy.
363,-3,-1,We've got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can't afford to live in the communities that they grew up in.
365,-3,-1,And I think the housing community is ready.
366,-3,-1,"But it's going to take a president who's committed to housing, who's had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream."
367,-3,-1,"And while I'm all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won't do."
368,-3,-1,"We've got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I'm prepared to do so."
369,-3,-1,This is one of the most important priorities that faces this country.
373,-3,-1,"Well, I certainly hope not."
375,-3,-1,Mr. Bush talked about values.
383,-3,-1,"Now, that's the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States."
386,-3,-1,"I've talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington."
389,-3,-1,But governors are ready; mayors are ready.
390,-3,-1,Builders and community leaders are ready.
391,-3,-1,"It will require some funds, John."
392,-3,-1,And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds.
393,-3,-1,"But that, too, will require some choices."
395,-3,-1,"Well, that's a choice we have to make, isn't it?"
396,-3,-1,"Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so."
397,-3,-1,Because it's so essential to our economic strength and to our future.
398,-3,-1,"Now, that's the kind of presidency I believe in."
400,-3,-1,"We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue."
403,-3,-1,I think the governor is blurring housing and the homeless.
404,-3,-1,Let's talk about housing which the question was.
405,-3,-1,"When you talk to those bankers, did they discuss where interest rates were when your party controlled the White House?"
407,-3,-1,"Now, how does that grab you for increasing housing?"
409,-3,1,We are serving a million more families now.
414,-3,-1,I want to see more vouchers.
415,-3,-1,"I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down."
417,-3,-1,"But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we'll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome - thank God for the United States on that one."
421,-3,-1,"No, I don't think there is."
422,-3,-1,"There are two very different issues here, and they've got to be dealt with separately."
427,-3,1,It's one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country.
429,-3,1,"You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute."
433,-3,-1,I don't think most people do.
434,-3,-1,The question is who makes the decision.
435,-3,-1,"And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision."
438,-3,1,It was the only one in the nation that furloughed murderers who had not served enough time to be eligible for parole.
440,-3,1,No other state programs do that.
441,-3,-1,And I favor the death penalty.
443,-3,-1,"But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life."
444,-3,-1,And I do believe it would be inhibiting.
445,-3,-1,"And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland."
447,-3,-1,And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.
450,-3,-1,I do not favor abortion.
458,-3,-1,"But I do know, I do know that I oppose abortion."
464,-3,-1,"Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it's much clearer for me now."
470,-3,-1,"Well, I think what the vice president is saying is that he's prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision."
472,-3,-1,"I don't think it's enough to come before the American people who are watching us tonight and say, well, I haven't sorted it out."
473,-3,-1,"This is a very, very difficult and fundamental decision that all of us have to make."
477,-3,-1,"Let me simply say that I think it has to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes that decision, and I think that's the right approach, the right decision, and I would hope by this time that Mr. Bush had sorted out this issue and come to terms with it as I have."
479,-3,-1,"But I think it's important that we have a position, that we take it, and we state it to the American people."
488,-3,-1,"But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible."
489,-3,-1,"That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program."
491,-3,-1,I think it is good.
493,-3,-1,"But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things."
494,-3,-1,"The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I'm talking about in terms of education."
497,-3,-1,And so it's a combination of these things.
498,-3,-1,But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light.
499,-3,-1,"The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty."
500,-3,-1,I'm for Head Start and moving that up.
501,-3,-1,"And I've already made a proposal - and yes, it will cost some money."
503,-3,-1,"So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don't think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program."
508,-3,-1,Let me just give you one other example.
512,-3,-1,That's the way you help people.
515,-3,-1,I know what's happened over the course of the past eight years.
524,-3,-1,That's just one example of how you can save money and improve the quality of life at the same time.
526,-3,-1,One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance.
527,-3,-1,Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can't play little league ball that he can't go out on the ball field because he's afraid he's going to get hurt.
528,-3,1,"And yet, Mr. Bush says well, I don't think we ought to expect business to provide health insurance for their employees, when responsible employers, a majority of employers in this country do and are paying more for their insurance to reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not insured, that have to go to that hospital."
529,-3,-1,"So these are the ways that you help families, you help youngsters to live better lives, and more decent lives."
530,-3,-1,"Were ready to go to work at the state and local level, all of us."
531,-3,-1,I know the private sector is.
532,-3,0,People are all over the country.
533,-3,-1,But it takes presidential leadership.
534,-3,-1,It takes a commitment to being involved and the leading.
535,-3,-1,And that's the kind of presidency I want to lead.
538,-3,-1,This is the problem I have with the big spending liberals.
542,-3,-1,But here's the point he misses.
545,-3,1,"We're putting more money per child into education, and we are not performing as we should."
547,-3,-1,And I would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path towards real excellence.
549,-3,-1,"But it's not going to be dedicated by some federal bureaucracy in Washington, D.C."
556,-3,-1,Of course that's a charge that's always made against any governor who runs for the presidency.
557,-3,0,I think it was one of the things that Mr. Bush said about Mr. Reagan back in 1980.
560,-3,-1,Its not the amount of time you spend in Washington.
561,-3,-1,It's not the length of your resume.
563,-3,-1,"It's your understanding of the forces of change that are sweeping the world, and whether or not you're in a position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work for us and not against us."
565,-3,-1,But it didn't stop him from endorsing the sale of arms to the Ayatollah.
570,-3,-1,So I don't believe that the fact you've got that long resume or had that experience is the real question.
571,-3,-1,"The question is values; the question is strength, the question is your willingness to provide the kind of leadership that must be provided."
572,-3,-1,I'm ready to provide that leadership.
574,-3,1,"I think it take fresh leadership now, and an understanding of those forces of change to provide the kind of strength that we need, and perhaps the vice president can explain what he was doing when he supported the trading of arms to terrorist nation, and his involvement in Panama and that endorsement of Mr. Macros."
575,-3,-1,But I don't think it's just experience that makes the difference.
578,-3,-1,"Well, I thought the question was about defense."
580,-3,1,"And because we didn't listen to the freeze advocates, and strengthen the defense of this country, we now have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age."
582,-3,-1,That is not the way you deal with the Soviets.
587,-3,-1,"I few have experience and now how to handle it, but please do not go back to the days when the military was as weak as they could be, when the morale was down, and when we were the laughing stock around the world."
588,-3,-1,"And now we are back, because we have strengthened the defenses of this country, and believe me, I don't want to see us return to those days."
589,-3,0,"As to Ferdinand Marcos, he isn't there any more."
596,-3,1,And he just lifted martial law.
598,-3,-1,And all of those things happened because the Philippines do crave democracy.
604,-3,-1,I don't think it's a question of eliminating.
605,-3,-1,I can tell him some I'm against.
610,-3,-1,"I mean, there's plenty of them that I oppose, but what I am not going to do, when we are negotiating with the Soviet Union, sitting down talking to Mr. Gorbachev about how we achieve a 50 percent reduction in our strategic weapons, I'm not going to give away a couple of aces I that very tough card game."
612,-3,-1,"And under me, when I lead this country, the secretary of defense is going to have to make the choices, between how we keep, how we protect the survivability of our nuclear deployment on the Midgetman missile, or on the Minuteman, whatever it is."
618,-3,-1,I hope it isn't Christmas when you make that decision.
619,-3,-1,wouldn't it be nice to be the ice man so you never make a mistake?
620,-3,-1,"These are the-my answer is do not make these unilateral cuts, and everybody now realizes that peace through strength works, and so this is where I have a big difference."
621,-3,-1,"Of course we're going to have to make some determination on this, and we're going to have to make it on the convention forces."
623,-3,-1,We will do what we do best.
625,-3,-1,It is going to take us to much better advantage in conventional forces.
628,-3,-1,I want to be the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth.
629,-3,-1,But you have to have a little bit of experience to know where to start.
630,-3,-1,And I think I've had that.
634,-3,-1,"I didn't hear, John, exactly where he was going to cut and what he was going to do."
635,-3,-1,"But I know this, we have serious financial problems in this country."
636,-3,1,We've piled up over a trillion dollars in debt and the next president of the United States is going to have to make some choices.
640,-3,-1,I thought the administration was at the negotiating table in Geneva suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely.
641,-3,-1,But those are the choices the next president of the United States is going to have to make.
642,-3,-1,"I'm for the Stealth, I'm for the D-5, I'm for going ahead with the advance Cruise missile."
643,-3,-1,But I don't think we need these other systems.
644,-3,-1,I don't think we need them to remain strong.
653,-3,-1,"Yes, I think it's fine to do business with them."
654,-3,-1,"And, so, I'm encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. -- what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off."
656,-3,-1,And now the Soviet Union seems to be walking down that same path.
660,-3,-1,"I'm not going to do that, because I think the jury is still out on the Soviet experiment."
661,-3,-1,And the interesting place-one of the things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is wheats going to happen in Eastern Europe.
662,-3,-1,You see the turmoil in Poland today.
666,-3,-1,But this is an exciting time.
667,-3,-1,But all I'm suggesting is let's not be naive in dealing with the Soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping against hope that they will match our bid.
669,-3,-1,"And if we haven't learned from the negotiating history on that, we'll never learn."
671,-3,-1,The Reagan-Bush administration was right.
674,-3,-1,"And you were right then, George, when you said it was no time for partisan demagoguery."
675,-3,-1,"Nobody is suggesting that we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength, of course not."
676,-3,-1,What we're talking about is a combination of a strong and effective and credible nuclear deterrent.
677,-3,-1,"Strong, well-equipped, well-trained, well-maintained conventional forces."
678,-3,-1,"And at the same time a willingness to move forward steadily, thoughtfully cautiously."
680,-3,-1,"We have very fundamental differences about human rights, democracy and our basic system, our basic view of human beings and of what life is all about."
681,-3,-1,But there are opportunities there now.
682,-3,-1,Senator Bentsen and I have a plan for the 1990's and beyond.
683,-3,-1,Mr. Bush and Mr. Quayle do not.
684,-3,-1,"And we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down the level of nuclear armament, will build a more stable and more peaceful world while making choices here at home."
685,-3,-1,Let's not forget that our national security and our economic security go hand in hand.
686,-3,-1,We cannot be strong militarily when we're teeter-tottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been created in the past eight years.
687,-3,-1,That's why we need a Democratic administration in Washington in 1989.
693,-3,-1,"No, there's been no change of heart."
698,-3,-1,"So, I'm for continued research, but I also want strong conventional forces."
701,-3,-1,We know where you're cutting right now.
702,-3,-1,You're cutting into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces.
704,-3,1,"An Air Force General not too long ago in Europe who said that pretty soon we'd have airplanes without engines, tank commanders who can't drive their tanks more than three-quarters of a mile, because they don't have enough fuel."
707,-3,-1,You have to make choices.
709,-3,-1,"And to spend billions and billions of dollars as Mr. Bush apparently wants to, although, he, himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately-on Star Wars-in my judgment makes no sense at all."
710,-3,-1,"We need a strong, credible, effective nuclear deterrent."
711,-3,1,"We have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads right now on land, on sea and in the air, enough to blow up the Soviet Union forty times over."
713,-3,-1,"So, we've got to move forward with those negotiations, get the level of strategic weapons down."
715,-3,-1,That's-at least that's what I read.
716,-3,-1,Maybe he'll tell us where he stand on it tonight.
720,-3,-1,Those are two hypo-rhetorical questions.
722,-3,-1,"The armed forces, the conventional forces of the United States have never been more ready."
723,-3,-1,Every single one of the Joint Chiefs will testify to the fact that readiness is in an historic high.
728,-3,-1,"I will fully research it, go forward as fast as we can."
729,-3,-1,"We've set up the levels of funding and when it is deployable, I will deploy it."
737,-3,-1,"Peter, it's one of the most agonizing decisions a president has to make."
740,-3,-1,"But if there's one thing we also understand it is that you cannot make concessions to terrorists, ever, ever."
741,-3,-1,"Because if you do, it's an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us."
742,-3,-1,And that's the tragedy of the Iran/Contra scandal.
744,-3,1,"And, yet, after sitting through meeting after meeting, he endorsed that decision, endorsed the sale of arms to the Ayatollah in exchange for hostages, one of the most tragic, one of the most mistaken foreign policy decisions we've ever made in this country and I dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know."
745,-3,-1,"So, there can be no concessions under any circumstances, because if we do it's an open invitation to others to do the same."
746,-3,-1,We've got to be tough on international terrorism.
747,-3,-1,We've got to treat it as international crime.
748,-3,-1,"We've got to attack at all points, we've go to use undercover operations."
749,-3,-1,"We have to be prepared to use military force against terrorist base camps, we have to work closely with our allies to make sure that they're working with us and we with them and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of international terrorism."
751,-3,-1,"That was a tragic mistake that we made, a mistake that Mr. Bush made and others made and it should never ever be made again."
754,-3,-1,It is the best anti-terrorist report written.
755,-3,-1,"Yes, we shouldn't trade arms for hostages."
764,-3,-1,And I've said mistakes were made.
766,-3,-1,That is a very serious charge against the president.
779,-3,-1,You're judged by the whole record.
782,-3,-1,Are we doing better in anti-terrorism?
787,-3,-1,Are the Soviets coming out of Afghanistan?
788,-3,-1,"How does it look in a program he called or some one of these marvelous Boston adjective up there and-about Angola-now, we have a chance-several Bostonians don't like it, but the rest of the country will understand."
791,-3,-1,Now we have a chance.
792,-3,-1,"And, so, I think that I'd leave it right there and say that you judge on the whole record."
793,-3,-1,And let me say this-all he can talk about-he goes around ranting about Noriega.
797,-3,0,I still have a couple of minutes left.
798,-3,-1,And there is a difference principle -
810,-3,-1,"25th of December, Mr. Vice President."
817,-3,1,A report on international terrorism chaired by the Vice President was released and made some very specific recommendations about how to deal with terrorism.
821,-3,-1,Very serious mistakes in judgment were made.
823,-3,1,Has made him a part of our foreign policy and has been funneling aid to Contras through convicted drug dealers.
824,-3,-1,"I think those are very very serious questions of judgment, which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to judge and review."
825,-3,-1,We're not going to make those kinds of mistakes.
827,-3,-1,"If you do, you invite the taking of more hostages."
836,-3,-1,I see a man who is young and I am putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their 30's and 40's.
841,-3,-1,And I'd like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal.
843,-3,-1,And he will do very very well.
844,-3,-1,And he has my full confidence and he'll have the confidence of people that are in their 30's and 40's and more.
845,-3,-1,"So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name."
848,-3,-1,And he'll do very well when we get into the debates.
851,-3,-1,I think we can agree on that in the course of this campaign.
856,-3,-1,"I think the American people have a right to judge us on this question, on how we picked a running mate, a person who is a heartbeat away from the presidency."
860,-3,-1,"And as a matter of fact, I think for most people the notion of President Quayle is a very very troubling thought."
868,-3,0,"Well, John, I'm a man that's been a chief executive for ten years."
876,-3,-1,"Somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the Ayatollah for hostages and say, Mr."
878,-3,-1,We shouldn't do that. That's the kind of Vice President I want.
881,-3,-1,And I'm very very proud of that choice.
882,-3,-1,And I didn't pick him because he agreed with me on everything.
884,-3,-1,"The fact is I've picked somebody who not only will be a great Vice President, but if, God forbid, something happens to the president, could step into that office and do so with distinction and with strength and with leadership."
886,-3,-1,I doubt very much that Mr. Bush's selection for the Vice Presidency of the United States meets that test.
889,-3,-1,"Well, I-we obviously have a difference."
891,-3,-1,"We'll have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in a friendly forum, wonderful friendly fashion like this."
895,-3,-1,But now we've got the lines too carefully drawn here.
896,-3,-1,But you talk about judgment.
899,-3,-1,"I mean, there's-I don't think this is a fair argument."
900,-3,-1,"But nevertheless, I support my nominee for Vice President and he'll do an outstanding job."
910,-3,-1,"I think it's going to require good, solid credit policies."
912,-3,-1,"I think it's going to require a combination of supply management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our farmers get a decent price and I think it also is going to require an administration that understand that there are tremendous opportunities out there for the development of new uses for agricultural products, new uses which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time."
913,-3,1,"Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products."
914,-3,-1,"I mean, there are enormous opportunities out there to expand markets and to build a strong future for our farmers."
915,-3,-1,But I don't think there's anything mutually exclusive or contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future for rural communities and for rural America and at the same time working on Third World debt.
923,-3,-1,"In terms of the Third World, I support the Baker plan."
925,-3,-1,And I don't want to see the banks let off the hook.
928,-3,-1,Let's try to expand our markets abroad.
939,-3,-1,I want to keep this expansion going.
940,-3,-1,"Yes, we want change but we are the change."
945,-3,-1,The best poverty program is a job with dignity in the private sector.
946,-3,-1,"And in terms of peace, we are on the right track."
949,-3,-1,I want to see asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces.
950,-3,-1,And then it gets down to a question of values.
951,-3,-1,We've had a chance to spell out our differences on the Pledge of Allegiance here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug king pins and this kind of thing.
952,-3,-1,And I do favor the death penalty.
954,-3,-1,"But in the final analysis-in the final analysis, the person goes into that voting booth, they're going to say, Who has the values I believe in?"
955,-3,-1,Who has the experience that we trust?
956,-3,-1,"Who has the integrity and stability to get the job done? My fellow Americans, I am that man and I ask for your support."
959,-3,-1,This has been an extraordinary 18 months for Kitty and me and for our family.
964,-3,-1,I believe in the American dream.
965,-3,-1,"I'm a product of it and I want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this land, with a good job and good wages, with good schools in every part of this country and every community in this country."
966,-3,-1,"With decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and live in, so that we end the shame of hopelessness in America."
967,-3,-1,With decent and affordable healthcare for all working families.
969,-3,-1,"It's one that we will solve and must solve, with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong America that's strong militarily and economically as we must be, an America that provides strong international leadership because we're true to our values."
970,-3,-1,"We have an opportunity working together to build that future, to build a better America, to build a best America, because the best America doesn't hide."
976,-3,-1,And the best America is not behind us.
1004,-3,-1,"Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have."
1005,-3,-1,"Which means, of course, that uh - we will have to maintain an adequate military capability - which means, of course, that we will have to add a uh - I think uh - a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces - adequate conventional forces."
1006,-3,-1,"I think the American people will be called upon to uh - uh - be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific."
1007,-3,-1,The American people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically.
1008,-3,-1,I don't think that uh - America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh - that would add significantly to the federal budget.
1009,-3,-1,"I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people."
1010,-3,-1,"And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh - four years."
1013,-3,-1,"Doesn't your policy really imply that we're going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that we're not gonna be able to do much - very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that."
1015,-3,-1,"overlapping, aren't those the real costs?"
1016,-3,1,"No, Mr. Kraft, we're spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh - by the federal government at the present time for human needs."
1017,-3,-1,Now we will probably need to increase that to same extent.
1018,-3,-1,But we don't have to have - growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation.
1019,-3,-1,I believe we can meet the problems within the cities of this country and still uh - give a tax reduction.
1020,-3,1,"I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars."
1021,-3,-1,"With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America."
1022,-3,-1,"Uh - a job, a home for all those that'll work and save for it, uh - safety in the streets, uh - health that is a - health care that is affordable."
1023,-3,-1,These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership.
1027,-3,1,Mr. Ford's own uh - environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he's uh - president.
1029,-3,-1,If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won't be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose.
1030,-3,-1,The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work.
1031,-3,-1,"And I think that this uh - is one example where uh - a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now."
1032,-3,0,"I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh - energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh - gasoline, to cut down on the uh - speed of automobiles."
1033,-3,-1,"It was a - a tremendous surge of patriotism, that ""I want to make a sacrifice for my country."""
1034,-3,-1,"I think we uh - could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let's have voluntary price restraints."
1035,-3,-1,Let's lay down some guidelines so we don't have continuing inflation.
1038,-3,1,"At the other extreme, uh - just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits."
1040,-3,-1,"But I think uh - uh - a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country."
1041,-3,-1,I know I'm ready for it.
1042,-3,-1,I think the American people are too.
1049,-3,1,I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials.
1050,-3,1,"When you've got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you've got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh - becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there's a natural inclination to be turned off."
1053,-3,-1,I - I have to say that my campaign has been an open one.
1055,-3,-1,I don't know how to deal with it exactly.
1056,-3,1,"Uh - I uh - agreed to give the interview uh - to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable - uh - Governor Jerry Brown, uh - Walter Cronkite, uh - Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford's own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh - William Buckley - many other people."
1057,-3,-1,"But they weren't running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh - interview had I do it - had it - I to do it over again."
1058,-3,-1,"If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my - my deep Christian beliefs and uh - condemnation and sinfulness, I'll use another forum besides Playboy."
1059,-3,-1,"But I can say this, uh - I'm doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh - television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford's character."
1061,-3,-1,"I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I'm trying to do away with those the last ten days."
1064,-3,-1,"I believe that the uh - American people have been turned off in this election, uh - Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons."
1065,-3,-1,"We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, uh - a great many uh - allegations of wrong-doing, of uh - alleged immorality, uh - those are very disturbing to the American people."
1066,-3,-1,They wonder how an elected representative uh - can serve them and participate in such activities uh - serving in the Congress of the United States.
1069,-3,-1,"But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America."
1072,-3,-1,"But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when we're asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh - we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation."
1078,-3,0,"Well, Mr. uh - Nelson, uh - I testified before two committees, House and Senate, on precisely the questions that you have asked."
1079,-3,1,"And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House."
1081,-3,1,"I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me."
1082,-3,0,"Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise."
1085,-3,-1,"Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all."
1086,-3,1,"But to add one other feature, I don't control any of the tapes."
1087,-3,-1,"Those tapes are in the jurisdiction of the courts and I have no right to say ""yes"" or ""no."""
1089,-3,-1,I think the matter is settled once and for all.
1093,-3,-1,That's for the uh - proper authorities who have control over those tapes to make that decision.
1096,-3,-1,And I've told everything I know about it.
1110,-3,0,"One is Governor Avell- Averell Harriman, who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the other is James Schlesinger, whom I think you accompanied to uh - China."
1113,-3,-1,"The present leadership uh - there is uh - is fairly uniform in - in their purpose, and I think it's a close-knit group, uh - and uh - I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh - in Yugoslavia uh - if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing."
1114,-3,-1,"I have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign, and this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question, that I would never uh - go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened."
1115,-3,-1,And uh - I don't believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh - into Yugoslavia.
1117,-3,-1,I certainly hope it won't.
1118,-3,-1,"I would take eh - the strongest possible measures short of uh - actual military uh - action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality."
1124,-3,-1,"I firmly believe, uh - Mr. Kraft, that it's unwise for a president to signal in advance what uh - options he might exercise if any uhh - international problem arose."
1126,-3,-1,"There are some who allege, I can't prove it true or untrue, that uh - such a statement uh - in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea."
1129,-3,-1,"It's far better for a person sitting in the White House uh - who has a number of options to make certain that the uh - other side, so to speak, doesn't know precisely what you're going to do."
1144,-3,0,"He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years."
1145,-3,-1,"And I think it's the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field, that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in America today."
1151,-3,-1,I think the first one was related to uh - the unwarranted influence of American Jews on the media and uh - in the Congress.
1152,-3,-1,This one concerned uh - Great Britain.
1155,-3,-1,"This is uh - something, though, that I think uh - is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and - and - and I think the only criticism that I would have uh - on - of Mr. Ford is that uh - immediately when the statement was re - re - revealed, uh - perhaps a - a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing."
1163,-3,-1,I don't believe it does.
1165,-3,-1,"At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win."
1166,-3,-1,Uh - very few people knew who I was.
1167,-3,0,"I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didn't hold public office, didn't have very much money."
1168,-3,0,"And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives."
1169,-3,0,"And we won the nomination by going out into the streets - barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers' markets and livestock sale barns - and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people."
1170,-3,-1,"And we built up uh - an awareness among the uh - voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered - thirty of them, nobody's ever done that before - about who I was and what I stood for."
1171,-3,0,"Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization."
1172,-3,0,"I'd say, several hundred of them."
1175,-3,-1,I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected.
1177,-3,-1,"And the only criterion I ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president, if something should happen to me and to join me in being vice president if I should serve out my term."
1178,-3,-1,"And I'm convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future."
1179,-3,0,Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make.
1180,-3,-1,"I don't want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I've never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration - Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States?"
1183,-3,-1,But I think this is indicative of what I would do.
1185,-3,-1,"The Governor may not have heard my uh - established criteria for the selection of a vice president, but uh - it was a well-established criteria that the person I selected would be fully qualified to be president of the United States."
1186,-3,0,"And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh - very high responsibilities on important committees."
1188,-3,-1,If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh - General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner.
1189,-3,0,"I don't think that's a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I'm sure the governor would agree with me on that."
1190,-3,-1,Uh - I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh - a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military.
1196,-3,-1,That's a tribute to their interest in this election.
1205,-3,1,"I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh - thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs."
1208,-3,1,"The auto emissions - uh - it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh - heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified."
1209,-3,-1,But let's talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment.
1210,-3,1,"I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution."
1211,-3,1,"I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program."
1212,-3,1,Uh - I have uh - added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service.
1213,-3,1,"For example, we uh - proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service."
1215,-3,1,"And then, of course, the - the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I've been president than any other president in the history of the United States."
1217,-3,-1,"Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right."
1219,-3,1,Uh - I think it's accurate to say that the uh - strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress - uh - and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden - would have been good for the country.
1224,-3,1,We have no energy policy.
1226,-3,-1,The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh - be clean.
1229,-3,-1,"But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, it's very uh - far in the future."
1230,-3,-1,"We've taken no strong position in the uh - control of pollution of our oceans, and I would say the worst uh - threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation."
1231,-3,1,"And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium."
1239,-3,-1,"Yes, I'd be glad to."
1241,-3,-1,"It's impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can't anticipate what's gonna happen next."
1243,-3,-1,"This has not been done, unfortunately."
1244,-3,0,"I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, ""Ford to New York: Drop Dead."""
1245,-3,-1,I think it's very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government.
1247,-3,-1,Uh - those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most.
1249,-3,-1,"Because of the uh - great -ly- greatly uh - advantaged uh - tho- per - persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it's needed."
1250,-3,-1,"Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care."
1251,-3,1,We have now uh - for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government.
1252,-3,1,"When uh - the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent."
1253,-3,1,That's a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years.
1257,-3,-1,"And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost."
1259,-3,-1,And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether.
1261,-3,-1,"Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a - a very serious problem there."
1265,-3,1,"I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh - states, uh - the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh - provide many, many services, whatever they really want."
1266,-3,1,In addition we uh - in the federal government make available to uh - cities about uh - three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development.
1267,-3,1,"In adesh- in addition, uh - uh - as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh - over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars."
1269,-3,-1,We're expanding our homestead uh - housing program.
1270,-3,0,"The net result is uh - we think under Carla Hills, who's the chairman of my uh - urban development and uh - neighborhood revitalization program, we will really do a first-class job in helping uh - the communities throughout the country."
1278,-3,-1,"Let me say at the outset, uh - I'm very proud of the record of this administration."
1280,-3,1,"You're familiar, I'm sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh - General James, and there was just uh - approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh - we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility."
1287,-3,-1,"I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I'm proud of the record."
1289,-3,-1,The uh - description just made of this administration's record is hard to uh - recognize.
1292,-3,-1,"There was a time when there was hope for those who uh - were poor and downtrodden and who were - uh elderly or who were - uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone."
1295,-3,1,"We've seen uh - in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh - section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh - Small Business Administration lend uh - a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt."
1296,-3,1,The bankruptcies have gone up - uh in an extraordinary degree.
1297,-3,1,"Uh - FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh - that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year."
1298,-3,1,"There've been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans."
1299,-3,-1,And now the federal government has become the world's greatest slum landlord.
1300,-3,1,We've got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh - young people.
1302,-3,-1,"And that's where there's been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future."
1303,-3,-1,But it doesn't take just a quiet uh - dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law.
1304,-3,-1,It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it.
1305,-3,-1,And that's been lacking in the last eight years.
1312,-3,-1,"Uh - we've always had, I think, a lot of constitutional amendments proposed, but the passage of them has been uh - fairly slow, and uh - few and far between."
1313,-3,-1,In the two-hundred-year history there's been a very uh - cautious approach to this.
1314,-3,-1,We - quite often we have a transient problem.
1315,-3,-1,I - I'm strongly against a- abortion.
1317,-3,-1,I don't think the government oughta do anything to encourage abortion.
1319,-3,-1,"But short of the constitutional amendment, and within the confines of the Supreme Court rulings, I'll do everything I can to minimize the need for abortions with better sex education, family planning, with better adoptive procedures."
1320,-3,-1,"I personally don't believe that the federal government oughta finance abortions, but I - I draw the line and don't support a constitutional amendment."
1321,-3,-1,"However, I honor the right of people who seek the constitutional amendments on school busing, on uh - prayer in the schools and an abortion."
1322,-3,-1,"But among those you named, I won't actively work for the passage of any of them."
1325,-3,-1,I favor the particular constitutional amendment that would turn over to the states the uh - individual right to the voters in those states uh - the chance to make a decision by public referendum.
1326,-3,-1,Uh I call that the people amendment.
1327,-3,-1,I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh - we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice.
1328,-3,-1,Uh - I think this is a responsible and a proper way to proceed.
1330,-3,-1,"Uh - it seems to me that there should have - be an opportunity, uh - as long as it's voluntary, as long as there is no uh - compulsion whatsoever, that uh - an individual ought to have that right."
1331,-3,-1,"So in those two cases I think uh - such uh - a constitutional amendment would be proper, and I really don't think in either case they're trivial matters."
1332,-3,-1,"I think they're matters of very deep conviction, as far as many, many people in this country believe."
1333,-3,-1,"And therefore, they shouldn't be treated lightly."
1334,-3,-1,But they're matters that are ah - important.
1335,-3,-1,"And in those two cases, I would favor them."
1343,-3,1,The record just doesn't prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective.
1344,-3,-1,"What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh - difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail."
1345,-3,-1,If we make the use of a gun in the commission.
1346,-3,-1,"of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason."
1347,-3,-1,I don't believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner.
1348,-3,-1,"That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity."
1349,-3,-1,Those are the people who ought to be in jail.
1350,-3,-1,"And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they'll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime."
1358,-3,-1,The person who wants to use a gun for an illegal purpose can get it whether it's registered or outlawed.
1360,-3,-1,And they are the people who ought to go behind bars.
1361,-3,-1,You should not in the process penalize the legitimate handgun owner.
1362,-3,-1,"And when you go through the process of registration, you in effect, are penalizing that individual who uses his gun for a very legitimate purpose."
1366,-3,-1,And it would've put uh - very strict uh - uh - control over who owned a handgun.
1368,-3,1,"And uh - the only purpose that I would see in registering uh - handguns and not long guns of any kind would be to prohibit the uh - ownership of those guns by those who've used them in the commission of a crime, or who uh - have been proven to be mentally incompetent to own a gun."
1369,-3,-1,"I believe that limited approach to the - to the question would be uh - advisable, and - and I think, adequate."
1376,-3,1,"While I was governor of Georgia, although I'm not a lawyer, we had complete reform of the Georgia court system."
1377,-3,-1,"We uh - streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh - severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity."
1379,-3,1,"Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court - and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges - I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia."
1381,-3,-1,So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion.
1382,-3,-1,"And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments."
1384,-3,1,"Civil rights - uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn't been uh - reversed, and I don't think there's any inclination to reverse those basic decisions."
1385,-3,-1,"The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh - s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley - uh populated areas of - of the states."
1386,-3,-1,The uh - right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh - legal counsel.
1387,-3,1,Uh - I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court.
1389,-3,1,But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty.
1392,-3,1,And - and that's a reversal of position uh by the Burger Court with which I do agree.
1395,-3,-1,"Once the uh - search and analysis procedure had been completed, and once I'm given a list of the five or seven or ten uh - best qualified persons in the country, I would make a selection from among those uh - persons."
1396,-3,-1,"If the uh - list was, uh - in my opinion, fairly uniform, if there was no outstanding person, then I would undoubtedly choose someone who would most accurately reflect my own basic politi- political philosophy as best I could determine it."
1398,-3,-1,"I would also like to uh - completely revise our criminal justice system - to do some of the things at the federal level in court reform that I've just described, as has been done in Georgia and other states."
1403,-3,-1,But when there's uh - a very narrow decision - which quite often there's one that reaches the Supreme Court - I think the choice should be with human rights.
1404,-3,-1,And uh - that would be another factor that I would follow.
1408,-3,-1,"I selected him because of his outstanding record as a Circuit Court of Appeals Judge, and I was very pleased that uh - an overwhelming Democratic United States Senate, after going into his background, came to the conclusion that he was uh - fit and should serve, and the vote in his behalf was overwhelming."
1412,-3,1,"The Miranda case, uh - the Burger Court uh - is gradually changing, and I'm pleased to see that there are some steps being made by the uh - Burger Court to modify the so-called Miranda decision."
1413,-3,1,"Uh - I might make a correction uh - of what uh - Governor Carter said, uh speaking of uh - uh - gun control, uh - yes, it is true, I believe that the sale of uh - Saturday Night S- Specials should be cut out, but he wants the registration of handguns."
1418,-3,-1,"Well, Mr. Kraft, uh - I violently disagree with your assessment."
1419,-3,-1,And I don't think the record justifies the conclusion that you come to.
1420,-3,-1,Uh - let me uh - talk about uh - the economic announcements that were made just this past week.
1421,-3,1,"Yes, it was announced that the uh - GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent."
1422,-3,1,But do you realize that over the last ten years that's a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period?
1423,-3,1,"Now it's lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it's lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter."
1424,-3,-1,"But every economist - liberal, conservative that I'm familiar with - recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh - the first quarter of next year that we'll have an increase in real GNP."
1425,-3,-1,But now let's talk about the pluses that came out this week.
1426,-3,1,We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts.
1427,-3,1,We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing.
1428,-3,1,"As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year."
1431,-3,1,"The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh - 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent."
1439,-3,-1,"Uh Mr. Kraft, uh - I think the record can be put in this uh - in this way, which uh - is the way that I think satisfies most Americans."
1440,-3,1,"Since the depths of the recession, we have added four million jobs."
1441,-3,1,"Im- most importantly, consumer confidence as surveyed by the reputable organization at the University of Michigan is at the highest since 1972."
1445,-3,-1,It means that there will be increased hires.
1446,-3,-1,It means that there will be increased employment.
1447,-3,1,"Now we've had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh - indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year."
1452,-3,-1,"We're going to see unemployment going down, more jobs available, and the rate of inflation going down."
1453,-3,-1,And I think this is a record that uh - the American people understand and will appreciate.
1455,-3,1,"With all due respect to President Ford, I think he ought to be ashamed of mentioning that statement, because we have the highest unemployment rate now than we had at any time between the Great Depression caused by Herbert Hoover and the time President Ford took office."
1456,-3,1,We've got seven and a half million people out of jobs.
1457,-3,1,"Since he's been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs."
1458,-3,1,"In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll."
1460,-3,-1,Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives.
1461,-3,-1,One of the overwhelming results that I've seen in the polls is that people feel that you can't plan anymore.
1462,-3,-1,There's no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college.
1467,-3,-1,And housing starts - he compares the housing starts with last year.
1468,-3,1,"I don't blame him, because in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country, fewer homes built, than any year since 1940."
1470,-3,1,And we've got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers.
1471,-3,1,And Mr. Ford hasn't done anything about it.
1473,-3,1,He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans.
1476,-3,-1,That is a very serious indictment of this administration.
1477,-3,-1,It's probably the worst one of all.
1484,-3,-1,"Well, that's not exactly an accurate description of what happened."
1489,-3,1,"I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent."
1491,-3,-1,"And the only poll I've ever followed is the one that uh - you know, is taken on election day."
1492,-3,0,"I was in uh - thirty primaries in the spring, and uh - at first it was obvious that I didn't have any standing in the poll."
1493,-3,1,"As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didn't put my name on the list."
1497,-3,-1,"So the polls to me are interesting, but they don't determine, you know, my hopes or - or my despair."
1499,-3,-1,I've never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office.
1500,-3,0,I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around - hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me.
1501,-3,1,"In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh - in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia."
1504,-3,-1,"So, the polls are interesting, but uh - I don't know how to explain the fluctuation."
1505,-3,-1,"I think a lot of it uh - depends on current events - uh - sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs."
1506,-3,-1,But I think our hold uh - of support among those who uh - are crucial to the election has been fairly steady.
1507,-3,-1,"And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who's from outside Washington, who - who never has been a part of the Washington establishment."
1508,-3,-1,And I think that we'll have good results uh - on November the second for myself and I hope for the country.
1510,-3,-1,"I think uh - the uh - increase and the uh - prospects as far as I'm concerned and the I - less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh - is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes."
1511,-3,-1,He tends to distort on a number of occasions.
1514,-3,1,"We - I mean in Korea - we had uh - three million five hundred thousand young men uh - in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines."
1515,-3,-1,That's not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment.
1516,-3,-1,At the present time we're at peace.
1519,-3,1,We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand.
1520,-3,-1,"If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less."
1521,-3,-1,"But this administration doesn't believe the way to reduce unemployment is to go to war, or to increase the number of people in the military."
1522,-3,1,"So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh - with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military - they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand."
1523,-3,0,They're in the civilian labor market and they're not fighting anywhere around the world today.
1530,-3,0,For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents.
1534,-3,-1,I became president at the time that the United States was in a very troubled time.
1535,-3,1,"We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam."
1536,-3,-1,The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself.
1539,-3,-1,But I am asking for your help and assistance to be president for the next four years.
1540,-3,-1,"During this campaign we've seen a lot of television shows, a lot of bumper stickers, and a great many uh - slogans of one kind or another."
1541,-3,-1,But those are not the things that count.
1542,-3,0,"What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth."
1543,-3,-1,"As a result of that wonderful experience all over the United States, there is a new spirit in America."
1544,-3,-1,"The American people are healed, are working together."
1545,-3,-1,"The American people are moving again, and moving in the right direction."
1547,-3,-1,We have came out of the recession and we're well on the road to real prosperity in this country again.
1548,-3,-1,"There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because I've been open, candid and forthright."
1549,-3,-1,I have never promised more than I could produce and I have produced everything that I promised.
1553,-3,-1,I've been proud to be president of the United States during these very troubled times.
1555,-3,-1,"It would be the highest honor for me to have your support on November second and for you to say, ""Jerry Ford, you've done a good job, keep on doing it."""
1563,-3,-1,We have been discouraged and we've been alienated.
1564,-3,-1,Sometimes we've been embarrassed and sometimes we've been ashamed.
1565,-3,-1,"Our people are out of work, and there's a sense of withdrawal."
1567,-3,0,"Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he's in - been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office."
1568,-3,-1,"I'd like to ask the American people what, what's been accomplished."
1569,-3,-1,A lot remains to be done.
1570,-3,0,My own background is different from his.
1572,-3,0,I served an a hospital authority.
1574,-3,-1,"And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington."
1575,-3,-1,"Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed."
1577,-3,1,We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax.
1578,-3,1,"As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia."
1579,-3,1,"We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country - every man, woman and child - for health care."
1580,-3,1,We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality.
1584,-3,-1,Employment ought to be restored to our people.
1586,-3,1,We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House.
1588,-3,-1,Our education system can be improved.
1592,-3,1,But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes.
1593,-3,1,The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country - $65 billion - primarily because our people are not at work.
1594,-3,-1,"Inflation is robbing us, as we've already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh - just a horrible mess."
1595,-3,-1,This doesn't have to be.
1598,-3,-1,"But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, ""I believe our nation is greater than what we are now."""
1599,-3,-1,"I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things."
1602,-3,-1,But I believe together we can make great progress.
1603,-3,-1,We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions.
1605,-3,-1,We've been drifting too long.
1606,-3,-1,We've been dormant too long.
1607,-3,-1,We've been discouraged too long.
1608,-3,-1,And we have not set an example for our own people.
1609,-3,-1,"But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country."
1610,-3,-1,And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things.
1612,-3,-1,"But more importantly, let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest nation on earth."
1656,-3,0,"There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me."
1672,-3,-1,"Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters -- to you -- which path we should take."
1685,-3,0,I've had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country.
1697,-3,-1,"Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America."
1700,-3,-1,We're far away from that now.
1701,-3,-1,"Number four, get to us a balanced budget."
1730,-3,1,"First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut."
1741,-3,-1,I'll call it the economy tax.
1748,-3,-1,And so the question is how to get them going again.
1750,-3,-1,"It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business."
1755,-3,1,"But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies."
1762,-3,1,"Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up."
1766,-3,1,"On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half."
1769,-3,-1,"And, by the way, I like coal."
1772,-3,-1,I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.
1782,-3,1,And that's exactly what I did.
1821,-3,-1,I will lower taxes on middle-income families.
1832,-3,-1,"For me, this is about jobs."
1844,-3,1,"So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times."
1857,-3,-1,"Jim, let me just come back on that -- on that point, which is these..."
1860,-3,-1,... the small businesses we're talking about...
1872,-3,1,"Well, President, you're -- Mr. President, you're absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not -- not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they're taxed at a lower rate."
1875,-3,1,And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.
1887,-3,-1,"Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people."
1898,-3,0,"Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word."
1903,-3,-1,I get the last word (inaudible) I hope.
1904,-3,-1,Let me just make this comment.
1917,-3,-1,And we talk about evidence.
1918,-3,-1,Look at the evidence of the last four years.
1922,-3,-1,Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.
1930,-3,-1,"I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue."
1932,-3,1,"And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral."
1942,-3,-1,I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.
1948,-3,-1,"I use that term with all respect, by the way."
1957,-3,-1,But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.
1965,-3,1,Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years.
1973,-3,1,That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.
1974,-3,-1,"Now, we all know that we've got to do more."
1978,-3,1,"And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit."
1986,-3,-1,It means that Governor Romney...
1999,-3,-1,"But in my view, the president should have grabbed it."
2014,-3,-1,"Let me come back and say, why is it that I don't want to raise taxes?"
2017,-3,1,"You said, ""Look, I'm going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we're in recession, you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone."""
2020,-3,-1,"And so if you believe the same thing, you just don't want to raise taxes on people."
2034,-3,-1,There has to be revenue in addition to cuts.
2058,-3,-1,Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that?
2060,-3,-1,"My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it."
2063,-3,-1,And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.
2087,-3,-1,So let's go through them one by one.
2093,-3,1,"Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives."
2099,-3,1,"But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1."
2101,-3,-1,So this -- this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.
2103,-3,0,"Look, I've been in business for 25 years."
2110,-3,-1,"And, finally, Medicaid to states?"
2112,-3,0,"And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that."
2113,-3,-1,We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.
2115,-3,-1,Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have.
2139,-3,0,And she ended up living alone by choice.
2142,-3,-1,And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements.
2143,-3,-1,"You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks."
2155,-3,-1,"So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further."
2161,-3,1,"But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program."
2167,-3,1,We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients.
2177,-3,-1,"And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question."
2188,-3,-1,"... people, right, not for current retirees."
2190,-3,1,"The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance."
2199,-3,1,"AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years."
2201,-3,1,"And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, ""Obamacare,"" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care."
2202,-3,1,They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.
2204,-3,-1,And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.
2215,-3,1,"So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000."
2224,-3,-1,The other thing we have to do to save Medicare?
2236,-3,-1,"And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere."
2247,-3,-1,Can we -- can we stay on Medicare?
2255,-3,-1,Let's get back to Medicare.
2290,-3,-1,Let me give you an example.
2295,-3,-1,This is an enormous boon for them.
2301,-3,-1,"Well, I would repeal and replace it."
2313,-3,-1,I think this is a great example.
2321,-3,1,We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s.
2323,-3,-1,You can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk.
2327,-3,-1,"And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation."
2331,-3,-1,But that's not what I believe.
2348,-3,-1,Try and get a mortgage these days.
2350,-3,-1,It's not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation.
2352,-3,-1,"I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs."
2368,-3,1,"And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance."
2370,-3,1,"And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family."
2396,-3,1,You keep your own doctor.
2399,-3,1,They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old.
2416,-3,1,What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.
2424,-3,1,"Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion."
2427,-3,1,"Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year."
2429,-3,1,"So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don't want Medicare -- don't want Obamacare."
2439,-3,0,And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.
2449,-3,-1,Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes.
2488,-3,1,The private market and individual responsibility always work best.
2489,-3,1,Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.
2492,-3,-1,"Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does."
2496,-3,1,It wasn't a government takeover of health care.
2507,-3,-1,Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?
2510,-3,1,And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.
2525,-3,-1,"Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000."
2526,-3,-1,Anybody can have deductions up to that amount.
2535,-3,-1,And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state.
2546,-3,-1,The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe.
2549,-3,-1,"But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed."
2563,-3,1,"In fact we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers."
2603,-3,-1,"And I -- and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he's -- some ideas he's put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and -- and congratulate him for pursuing that."
2610,-3,1,"Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now."
2612,-3,1,"You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices."
2614,-3,1,"You know, his -- his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about."
2628,-3,1,"So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system."
2633,-3,-1,"And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids."
2643,-3,-1,"But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is."
2646,-3,1,"$90 billion, that would have -- that would have hired 2 million teachers."
2661,-3,-1,This is not because I didn't have commitment to education.
2707,-3,-1,"When -- when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have."
2714,-3,-1,"Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it."
2717,-3,-1,And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished.
2722,-3,-1,"All those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is -- is channeled and -- and they have an opportunity to succeed."
2724,-3,-1,"And everybody's getting a fair share -- everybody's doing a fair share, and everybody's playing by the same rules."
2731,-3,-1,And thank you for tuning in this evening.
2733,-3,-1,I'm concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.
2738,-3,0,"And there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we're going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate."
2740,-3,-1,But they lead in very different directions.
2743,-3,-1,There's no question in my mind that if the president were to be reelected you'll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.
2755,-3,1,You'll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage.
2792,-3,-1,"Well I think this Republican administration has been almost all style, and spectacular, and not substance."
2793,-3,-1,"We've uh - got a chance tonight to talk about, first of all, leadership, the character of our country, and a vision of the future."
2794,-3,-1,"In every one of these instances, the Ford administration has failed, and I hope tonight that I and Mr. Ford will have a chance to discuss the reasons for those failures."
2796,-3,-1,We can only be strong overseas if we're strong at home; and when I became president we'll not only be strong in those areas but also in defense - a defense capability second to none.
2797,-3,-1,"We've lost in our foreign policy, the character of the American people."
2798,-3,-1,We've uh - ignored or excluded the American people and the Congress from participation in the shaping of our foreign policy.
2799,-3,-1,It's been one of secrecy and exclusion.
2800,-3,-1,"In addition to that we've had a chance to became now, contrary to our long-standing beliefs and principles, the arms merchant of the whole world."
2801,-3,-1,"We've tried to buy success from our enemies, and at the same time we've excluded from the process the normal friendship of our allies."
2802,-3,-1,In addition to that we've become fearful to compete with the Soviet Union on an equal basis.
2805,-3,-1,We have not known what we've wanted and we've been out-traded in almost every instance.
2806,-3,-1,The other point I wanna make is about our defense.
2807,-3,-1,"We've got to be a nation blessed with a defense capability that's efficient, tough, capable, well organized, narrowly focused - fighting capability."
2808,-3,-1,"The ability to fight, if necessary, is the best way to avoid the chance for, or the requirement to fight."
2809,-3,-1,"And the last point I wanna make is this: Mr. Ford, Mr. Kissinger have uh - continued on with the policies and failures of Richard Nixon."
2810,-3,1,Even the Republican platform has criticized the lack of leadership in Mr. Ford and they've criticized the foreign policy of this administration.
2811,-3,-1,This is one instance where I agree with - with the Republican platform.
2814,-3,-1,That's got to be changed.
2815,-3,-1,And that's one of the major issues in this uh - campaign of 1976.
2818,-3,-1,Let me take just one question that he raises - the military strength and capability of the United States.
2819,-3,1,Governor Carter in November of 1975 indicated that he wanted to cut the defense budget by $15 billion.
2820,-3,1,"A few months later, he said he wanted to cut the defense budget by eight or nine billion dollars."
2822,-3,-1,There is no way you can be strong militarily and have those kind of reductions in our military uh - appropriation.
2823,-3,-1,Now let me just tell you a little story.
2829,-3,-1,Let me tell you this straight from the shoulder.
2830,-3,-1,You don't negotiate with Mr. Brezhnev from weakness.
2831,-3,-1,And the kind of defense program that Mr. Carter wants will mean a weaker defense and a poor negotiating position.
2839,-3,-1,I don't believe we should move to a cold-war relationship.
2840,-3,-1,"I think it's in the best interest of the United States, and the world as a whole that the United States negotiate rather than go back to the cold-war relationship with the Soviet Union."
2841,-3,-1,"I don't uh - look at the picture as bleakly as you have indicated in your question, Mr. Trewhitt."
2847,-3,1,"Today, according to Prime Minister Rabin, the Soviet Union is weaker in the Middle East than they have been in many, many years."
2851,-3,-1,But let's turn for a minute to the uhh - southern African operations that are now going on.
2853,-3,-1,We wanted to end the bloodshed in southern Africa.
2856,-3,-1,We wanted to preserve human dignity in southern Africa.
2857,-3,1,"We have taken the initiative, and in southern Africa today the United States is trusted by the black front-line nations and black Africa."
2859,-3,-1,The United States foreign policy under this administration has been one of progress and success.
2861,-3,-1,"And may I make an observation - part of the question you asked, Mr. Trewhitt?"
2862,-3,-1,I don't believe that it's in the best interest of the United States and the NATO nations to have a Communist government in NATO.
2864,-3,-1,"I think that would destroy the integrity and the strength of NATO, and I am totally opposed to it."
2868,-3,-1,"I think that this is uh - an instance of uh - deliberate distortion, and this has occurred also in the question about defense."
2869,-3,1,"As a matter of fact, uh - I've never advocated any cut of $15 billion in our defense budget."
2872,-3,1,"After he fired James Schlesinger, the political heat got so great that he added back about $3 billion."
2873,-3,1,"When Ronald Reagan won the Texas primary election, Mr. Ford added back another one and a half billion dollars."
2874,-3,1,"Immediately before the Kansas City convention, he added back another one point eight billion dollars in the defense budget."
2875,-3,1,And his own uh - Office of Management and Budget testified that he had a $3 billion cut insurance added to the defense budget - defense budget under the pressure from the Pentagon.
2876,-3,-1,"Obviously, this is another indication of trying to use the defense budget for political purposes, which he's trying to do tonight."
2885,-3,-1,"Well, I'm not gonna name my cabinet before I get elected."
2886,-3,-1,I've got a little ways to go before I start doing that.
2889,-3,0,"Naval Academy, the first military graduate since uh - Eisenhower."
2890,-3,0,"I've served as the Governor of Georgia and have traveled extensively in foreign countries and South America, Central America, Europe, the Middle East and in Japan."
2891,-3,0,I've traveled the last twenty-one months among the people of this country.
2893,-3,-1,"And I've seen at first hand, in a very vivid way, the deep hurt that's come to this country in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia, Chile, and Pakistan, and Angola, and Watergate, CIA revelations."
2894,-3,-1,"What we were formerly so proud of - the strength of our country, its uh - moral integrity, the representation in foreign affairs of what our people are, what our Constitution stands for, has been gone."
2896,-3,-1,I believe I know what this country ought to be.
2897,-3,-1,"I've uh - been one who's loved my nation as many Americans do, and I believe that there's no limit placed on what we can be in the future, if we can harness the tremendous resources - militarily, economically, and the stature of our people, the meaning of the Constitution, in the future."
2898,-3,-1,"Every time we've made a serious mistake in foreign affairs, it's been because the American people have been excluded from the process."
2899,-3,-1,"If we can just tap the intelligence and ability, the sound common sense and the good judgment of the American people, we can once again have a foreign policy to make us proud instead of ashamed."
2900,-3,1,"And I'm not gonna exclude the American people from that process in the future, as Mr. Ford and Kissinger have done."
2901,-3,-1,"This is what it takes to have a sound foreign policy strong at home, strong defense, permanent commitments, not betray the principles of our country, and involve the American people and the Congress in the shaping of our foreign policy."
2903,-3,-1,"So these are the ways that we can restore the strength of our country, and they don't require long experience in foreign policy."
2909,-3,1,"In many instances we've made agreements, like in Vietnam, uh - that have uh - been revealed later on to our uh - embarrassment."
2911,-3,-1,The American people don't know what those commitments are.
2912,-3,1,"We've seen uh - in the past the destruction of elected governments, like in Chile, and the strong support of military dictatorship there."
2913,-3,-1,These kinds of things have hurt us very much.
2915,-3,-1,And I would also restore the involvement of the Congress.
2917,-3,-1,"Dean Acheson, George Marshall were strong secretaries of uh - state - excuse me - state."
2924,-3,1,He complains about secrecy and yet he is quoted as saying that in the attempt to find a solution in the Middle East that he would hold unpublicized meetings with the Soviet Union - I presume for the purpose of an - imposing a settlement on Israel and the Arab nations.
2925,-3,-1,But let me talk just a minute about what we've done to avoid secrecy in the Ford administration.
2926,-3,1,After the United States took the initiative in working with Israel and with Egypt and achieving the Sinai II agreement - and I'm proud to say that not a single Egyptian or Israeli soldier has lost his life since the signing of the Sinai agreement.
2929,-3,1,"Now as far as meeting with the Congress is concerned, during the twenty-four months that I've been the president of the United States I have averaged better than one meeting a month with responsible groups or committees of the Congress - both House and Senate."
2930,-3,1,The secretary of state has appeared in the several years that he's been the secretary before eighty different uh - committee hearings in the House and in the Senate.
2932,-3,0,I have made myself at least ten uh - speeches in various parts of the country where I have discussed with the American people defense and foreign policy.
2943,-3,1,I believe that we have uh - negotiated with the Soviet Union since I've been president from a position of strength.
2945,-3,1,"Shortly after I became president in uh - December of 1974, I met with uh - General Secretary Brezhnev in Vladivostok and we agreed to a mutual cap on the ballistic missile launchers at a ceiling of twenty-four hundred - which means that the Soviet Union, if that becomes a permanent agreement, will have to make a reduction in their launchers that they now have or plan to have."
2946,-3,1,"I've negotiated at Vladivostok with uh - Mr. Brezhnev a limitation on the MIRVing of their ballistic missiles at a figure of thirteen-twenty, which is the first time that any president has achieved a cap either on launchers or on MIRVs."
2947,-3,-1,It seems to me that we can go from there to uh - the uh - grain sales.
2949,-3,1,"We have achieved a five and three quarter year uh - sale of a minimum six million metric tons, which means that they have already bought about four million metric tons this year and are bound to buy another two million metric tons to take the grain and corn and wheat that the American farmers have produced in order to uh - have full production."
2951,-3,-1,"If we turn to Helsinki - I'm glad you raised it, Mr. uh - Frankel."
2952,-3,1,"In the case of Helsinki, thirty-five nations signed an agreement, including the secretary of state for the Vatican - I can't under any circumstances believe that the - His Holiness, the Pope would agree by signing that agreement that the thirty-five nations have turned over to the Warsaw Pact nations the domination of the - Eastern Europe."
2954,-3,-1,"And if Mr. Carter alleges that His Holiness by signing that has done it, he is totally inaccurate."
2955,-3,-1,"Now, what has been accomplished by the Helsinki agreement?"
2956,-3,1,"Number one, we have an agreement where they notify us and we notify them of any uh - military maneuvers that are to be be undertaken."
2961,-3,-1,"I don't believe, uh - Mr. Frankel that uh - the Yugoslavians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union."
2962,-3,-1,I don't believe that the Rumanians consider themselves dominated by the Soviet Union.
2964,-3,1,"Each of those countries is independent, autonomous: it has its own territorial integrity and the United States does not concede that those countries are under the domination of the Soviet Union."
2965,-3,0,"As a matter of fact, I visited Poland, Yugoslavia and Rumania to make certain that the people of those countries understood that the president of the United States and the people of the United are dedicated to their independence, their autonomy and their freedom."
2967,-3,-1,"(chuckle) Well, in the first place, I'm not criticizing His Holiness the Pope."
2969,-3,-1,The uh - fact is that secrecy has surrounded the decisions made by the Ford administration.
2973,-3,-1,And I would like to see Mr. Ford convince the Polish-Americans and the Czech-Americans and the Hungarian-Americans in this country that those countries don't live under the domination and supervision of the Soviet Union behind the Iron - uh - Curtain.
2979,-3,1,"The Arabs have put pressure on Mr. Ford, and he's yielded, and has permitted a boycott by the Arab countries of American businesses who trade with Israel, or who have American Jews owning or taking part in the management of American - companies."
2984,-3,-1,"That's not the way to run our foreign policy, including international trade."
2990,-3,-1,I would never single out food as a trade embargo item.
2994,-3,-1,I wouldn't single out just food.
2996,-3,1,"When this Republican administration came into office we were shipping about $1 billion worth of arms overseas, now ten to twelve billion dollars worth of arms overseas to countries that quite often use these weapons to fight each other."
2998,-3,1,Under the last Democratic administration 60 percent of all weapons that went into the Middle East were for Israel.
2999,-3,1,Nowadays - 75 percent were for Israel before.
3001,-3,1,"If you include Iran, our present shipment of weapons to the Middle East, only 20 percent goes to Israel."
3003,-3,-1,We still have no comprehensive energy policy in this country.
3005,-3,-1,"When we are weak at home economically - high unemployment, high inflation, a confused government, a wasteful defense establishment, this encourages the kind of pressure that's been put on us successfully."
3006,-3,-1,"It would've been inconceivable ten - fifteen years ago, for us to be brought to our knees with an Arab oil embargo."
3007,-3,1,But it was done three years ago and they're still putting pressure on us from the Arab countries to our discredit around the world.
3008,-3,-1,"These are the weaknesses that I see, and I believe it's not just a matter of idealism."
3009,-3,-1,It's a matter of being tough.
3010,-3,-1,It's a matter of being strong.
3011,-3,-1,It's a matter of being consistent.
3012,-3,-1,"Our priorities ought to be first of all to meet our own military needs, secondly to meet the needs of our allies and friends, and only then should we ship military equipment to foreign countries."
3014,-3,1,And the shipment of Spruance-class destroyers to Iran are much more highly sophisticated than the Spruance-class destroyers that are present being delivered to our own Navy.
3015,-3,-1,This is ridiculous and it ought to be changed.
3020,-3,-1,And I would make sure that the uh - Saudis understood this ahead of time so there would be no doubt in their mind.
3021,-3,1,I think under those circumstances they would refrain from pushing us to our knees as they did in 1973 with their previous oil embargo.
3023,-3,1,Governor Carter uh - apparently doesn't realize that since I've been president we have sold to the Israelis over $4 billion in military hardware.
3025,-3,-1,"So the Ford administration has done a good job in helping our good ally, Israel, and we're dedicated to the survival and security of Israel."
3026,-3,-1,I believe that Governor Carter doesn't realize the need and necessity for arms sales to Iran.
3030,-3,0,"The Soviet Union and the Communist-dominated government of Iraq are neighbors of Iran, and Iran is an ally of the United States."
3031,-3,-1,"It's my strong feeling that we ought to sell arms to Iran for its own national security, and as an ally - a strong ally of the United States."
3033,-3,1,"In 1973 when there was an oil embargo, Iran did not participate."
3036,-3,-1,It's for their security as well as ours.
3044,-3,-1,It doesn't uh - make a determination as to how uh - that relationship should be achieved in relationship to our current uhh - diplomatic recognition and obligations to the Taiwanese Government.
3045,-3,1,"The Shanghai Communique, does say that the differences between the People's Republic on the one hand and Taiwan on the other shall be settled by peaceful means."
3046,-3,-1,"The net result is this administration, and during my time as the president for the next four years, we will continue to move for normalization of relations in the traditional sense, and we will insist that the disputes between Taiwan and the People's Republic be settled peacefully, as was agreed in the Shanghai Communique, of 1972."
3047,-3,-1,"The Ford administration will not let down, will not eliminate or forget our obligation to the people of Taiwan."
3048,-3,-1,"We feel that there must be a continued obligation to the people, the some nineteen or twenty million people in Taiwan."
3049,-3,-1,"And as we move during the next four years, those will be the policies of this administration."
3052,-3,-1,"I do not believe that we, the United States, should sell, give or otherwise transfer military hardware to the People's Republic of China, or any other Communist nation, such as the Soviet Union and the like."
3055,-3,1,"As a matter of fact, during this current year uh we are shipping Iran, or have contracted to ship to Iran, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms and also to Saudi Arabia, about seven and a half billion dollars worth of arms."
3059,-3,-1,"There ought to be a clear, unequivocal commitment without change to Israel."
3060,-3,-1,In the Far East I think we need to continue to be uh - strong and uh - I would certainly uh - pursue the uh - normalization of uh - relationships with the People's Republic of China.
3062,-3,-1,But I would never let that friendship with the People's Republic of China stand in the way of the preservation of the independence and freedom of the people on Taiwan.
3067,-3,-1,"Well, always in the past we've had an ability to have a strong defense and also have - to have a strong uh - domestic economy, and also to be strong in our reputation and influence within the community of nations."
3068,-3,-1,These uh - characteristics of our country have been endangered under Mr. Ford.
3070,-3,-1,Our allies feel that we've neglected them.
3074,-3,1,The worst inflation since the Great Depression.
3076,-3,1,"We have a higher unemployment rate in this country than Great Britain, and West Germany."
3077,-3,1,Our unemployment rate is twice as high as it is in Italy; it's three or four times as high as it is - as it is in Japan.
3078,-3,-1,And that terrible circumstance in this country is exported overseas.
3079,-3,1,We comprise about 30 percent of the world's economic trade power influence.
3080,-3,-1,And when we're weak at home - weaker than all our allies - that weakness weakens the whole free world.
3081,-3,-1,So strong economy is very important.
3082,-3,-1,Another thing that we need to do is to reestablish the good relationships that we ought to have between the United States and our natural allies and friends.
3084,-3,-1,"And using that base of strength, and using the idealism, the honesty, the predictability, the commitment, the integrity of our own country, that's where our strength lies."
3085,-3,-1,And that would permit us to deal with the developing nations in a position of strength.
3087,-3,-1,Our allies - the smaller countries get trampled in the rush.
3088,-3,-1,"What we need is to try to seek individualized bilateral relationships with countries, regardless of their size, and to establish world-order politics, which means that we want to preserve peace through strength."
3089,-3,-1,We also wanna revert back to the stature and the respect that our country had in previous administrations.
3091,-3,-1,But I can guarantee it will not come if Gerald Ford is reelected and this present policy is continued; it will come if I'm elected.
3095,-3,1,"Well let me say very quickly that under President Johnson, in spite of the massive investment in the Vietnam War, he turned over a balanced budget to Mr. Nixon."
3097,-3,1,The inflation rate under Kennedy and Johnson was about 2 percent - one-third what it is under this administration.
3100,-3,-1,"But I can say this: The number one responsibility of any president, above all else, is to guarantee the security of our nation - an ability to be free of the threat of attack, or blackmail and to carry out our obligations to our allies and friends, and to carry out a legitimate foreign policy."
3101,-3,-1,"They must go hand in hand, but the security of this nation has got to come first."
3103,-3,-1,Let me say very categorically you cannot maintain the security of the United States with the kind of defense budget cuts that Governor Carter has indicated.
3104,-3,1,In 1975 he wanted to cut the budget $15 billion.
3105,-3,1,He's now down to a figure of five to seven billion dollars.
3106,-3,-1,Reductions of that kind will not permit the United States to be strong enough to deter aggression and maintain the peace.
3107,-3,-1,Governor Carter apparently doesn't know the facts.
3108,-3,1,"As soon as I became president, I initiated a meeting with the NATO heads of state and met with them in Brussels to discuss how we could improve the re- defense relationship in Western Europe."
3113,-3,0,I was the first United States president to visit Japan.
3115,-3,-1,You can go around the world - and let me take Israel for example.
3116,-3,1,"Just recently, President Rabin said that our relations were never better."
3126,-3,1,"As I indicated earlier, we did agree on a twenty-four-hundred limitation on uh - uh - launchers of ballistic missiles."
3128,-3,1,"At the same time, we put a limitation of thirteen hundred and twenty on MIRVs."
3131,-3,1,"In the interim, there has been the development on our part primarily, the cruise missiles; cruise missiles that could be launched from land-based mobile installations; cruise missiles that could be launched - launched from high-performance aircraft, like the B-52s or the B-1s, which I hope we proceed with; cruise missiles which could be launched from either surface or submarine uh - naval vessels."
3132,-3,1,Those gray-area weapons systems are creating some problems in a - the agreement for a SALT II negotiation.
3134,-3,-1,"I hope and trust, in the best interest of both countries, and in the best interests of all people throughout this globe, that the Soviet Union and the United States can make a mutually beneficial agreement."
3136,-3,-1,"So it's the obligation of the president to do just that, and I intend to do so."
3143,-3,-1,"I think good will on both parts, hard bargaining by both parties and a reasonable compromise will be in the best interests of all parties."
3145,-3,-1,"Well, Mr. Ford acts like he's uh - running for president for the first time."
3146,-3,1,"He's been in office two years, and there has been absolutely no progress made toward a new SALT agreement."
3150,-3,-1,I also - know that as far as the human beings on this earth are concerned that the nonproliferation of atomic weapons is number one.
3152,-3,1,"I advocated last May in a speech at the United Nations that we move immediately as a nation to declare a complete moratorium on the testing of all nuclear devices, both weapons and peaceful devices; that we not ship any more atomic fuel to a country that refuses to comply with strict controls over the waste which can be reprocessed into explosives."
3153,-3,1,I've also advocated that we stop the sale by Germany and France of - processing plants for Pakistan and Brazil.
3154,-3,1,Mr. Ford hasn't moved on this.
3155,-3,-1,We also need to provide an adequate supply of enriched uranium.
3158,-3,1,We now have five nations that have atomic bombs that we know about.
3160,-3,-1,This has got to be stopped.
3161,-3,-1,That is one of the major challenges and major undertakings that I will assume as the next president.
3166,-3,-1,"No, it's not just campaign rhetoric."
3167,-3,-1,I think that militarily we are as strong as any nation on earth.
3169,-3,-1,"But as far as strength derived from commitment to principles, as far as strength derived from the unity within our country, as far as strength derived from the people, the Congress, the secretary of state, the president, sharing in the evolution and carrying-out of a foreign policy, as far as strength derived from the respect of our own allies and friends, their assurance that we will be staunch in our commitment, that we will not deviate and that we'll give them adequate attention, as far as - as strength derived from doing what's right - caring for the poor, providing food, becoming the breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world - in those respects, we're not strong."
3171,-3,-1,And with our economy in such terrible disarray and getting worse by the month.
3172,-3,1,We've got five-hundred thousand more Americans unemployed today than we had three months ago.
3173,-3,1,We've got two and a half million more Americans out of work now than we had when Mr. Ford took office.
3174,-3,-1,This kind of deterioration in our economic strength is bound to weaken us around the world.
3176,-3,-1,"So as far as the respect of our own people toward our own government, as far as participating in the shaping of uh - concepts and commitments, as far as the trust of our country among the nations of the world, as far as dependence of our country in meeting the needs and obligations that we've expressed to our allies, as far as the respect of our country - even among our potential adversaries - we are weak."
3178,-3,-1,Under this administration that strength has not been realized.
3180,-3,-1,Governor Carter uh - brags about the unemployment during Democratic administrations and condemns the unemployment at the present time.
3182,-3,-1,Now let me correct one other comment that uh - Governor Carter has made.
3184,-3,-1,"But I am committed to the one at Portsmouth, Ohio."
3186,-3,-1,The foreign policy of the United States meets the highest standards of morality.
3187,-3,-1,"What is more moral than peace, and the United States is at peace today?"
3188,-3,1,What is more moral in foreign policy than for the administration to take the lead in the World Food Conference in Rome in 1974 when the United States committed six million metric tons of food - over 60 percent of the food committed for the disadvantaged and underdeveloped nations of the world?
3190,-3,-1,"What is more moral than for the United States under the Ford administration to take the lead in southern Africa, in the Middle East?"
3191,-3,-1,Those are initiatives in foreign policy which are of the highest moral standard and that is indicative of the foreign policy of this country.
3203,-3,-1,I believe that uh - our foreign policy must express the highest standards of morality.
3205,-3,-1,"If the United States had not moved when we did in southern Africa, there's no doubt there would have been an acceleration of bloodshed in that tragic part of the world."
3206,-3,-1,"If we had not taken our initiative, it's very, very possible that uh - the government of Rhodesia would have been overrun and that the Soviet Union and the Cubans would have dominated uh - southern Africa."
3207,-3,-1,"So the United States, seeking to preserve the principle of self-determination, to eliminate the possibility of bloodshed, to protect the rights of the minority as we insisted upon the rights of the majority, uh - I believe followed the good conscience of the American people in foreign policy."
3208,-3,-1,And I believe that we used our skill.
3210,-3,1,"He has done a superb job in getting the prime minister of South Africa, Mr. Vorster, to agree that the time had come for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia."
3212,-3,-1,"This is a perfect example of the kind of leadership that the United States, under this administration, has taken."
3213,-3,-1,"And I can assure you that this administration will follow that high moral principle in our future efforts in foreign policy, including our efforts in the Middle East where it is vitally important because the Middle East is the crossroads of the world."
3214,-3,-1,There've been more disputes in its area where there's more volatility than any other place in the world.
3216,-3,-1,"And I can assure you that the United States will have the leadership role in moving toward a comprehensive settlement of the Middle Eastern problems, I hope and trust as soon as possible."
3217,-3,-1,And we will do it with the highest moral principles.
3220,-3,-1,"I would hope that as we move to one area of the world from another - and the United States must not spread itself too thinly - that was one of the problems that helped to create the circumstances in Vietnam - but as we as a nation find that we are asked by the various parties, either one nation against another or individuals within a nation, that the United States will take the leadership and try to resolve the differences."
3221,-3,-1,Let me take uh - South Korea as an example.
3223,-3,-1,But I think in all fairness and equity we have to recognize the problem that South Korea has.
3224,-3,1,"On the north they have North Korea with five hundred thousand well-trained, well-equipped troops - they are supported by the People's Republic of China; they are supported by the Soviet Union."
3227,-3,-1,"This is a leadership role that the United States under this administration is carrying out, and if we do it, and I think the opportunities and the possibilities are getting better, we will have solved many of the internal domestic problems that exist in South Korea at the present time."
3230,-3,1,"This is an - a typical example, maybe of many others, where this administration overthrew an elected government and helped to establish a military dictatorship."
3231,-3,-1,This has not been an ancient history story.
3232,-3,1,"Last year under Mr. Ford, of all the Food for Peace that went to South America, 85 percent went to the military dictatorship in Chile."
3233,-3,-1,Another point I wanna make is this.
3236,-3,-1,"While the secretary of state's in one country, there are almost a hundred and fifty others that are wondering what we're gonna do next, what will be the next secret agreement."
3238,-3,1,"Another thing that concerned me was what Mr. Ford said about unemployment, that - insinuating that under Johnson and Kennedy that unemployment could only be held down when this country is at war."
3240,-3,0,Karl Marx was the grandfather of Communism.
3242,-3,-1,I hope Mr. Ford doesn't either.
3243,-3,1,He has put pressure on the Congress - and I don't believe Mr. Ford would even deny this - to hold up on nonproliferation legislation until the Congress agreed for an $8 billion program for private industry to start producing enriched uranium.
3244,-3,-1,And the last thing I wanna make is this.
3245,-3,-1,He talks about peace and I'm thankful for peace.
3256,-3,-1,"Well, here again, uh - the Panamanian question is one that's been confused by Mr. Ford."
3257,-3,1,Uh - he had directed his uh - diplomatic relation - uh - uh - representative to yield to the Panamanians full sovereignty over the Panama Canal Zone at the end of a certain period of time.
3259,-3,-1,"I would never give up complete control or practical control of the Panama Canal Zone, but I would continue to negotiate with the Panamanians."
3265,-3,-1,"I might even be willing to reduce to some degree our military emplacements in the Panama Canal Zane, but I would not relinquish practical control of the Panama Canal Zane any time in the foreseeable future."
3267,-3,-1,The United States must and will maintain complete access to the Panama Canal.
3268,-3,-1,The United States must maintain a defense capability of the Panama Canal.
3269,-3,-1,And the United States will maintain our national security interest in the Panama Canal.
3270,-3,1,The negotiations far the Panama Canal started under President Johnson and have continued up to the present time.
3271,-3,-1,I believe those negotiations should continue.
3273,-3,-1,Let me take just a minute to comment on something that Governor Carter said.
3275,-3,0,That conference has met six times.
3280,-3,1,The White House did not uh - prevent the release of that report.
3281,-3,1,"On July twelfth of this year, we gave full permission for the release of that report."
3284,-3,-1,"Somebody who sits in Washington, D.C., eighteen months after the Mayaguez incident, can be a very good grandstand quarterback."
3285,-3,-1,And let me make another observation.
3286,-3,0,"This morning, I got a call from the skipper of the Mayaguez."
3288,-3,-1,"And I can assure you that if we had not taken the strong and forceful action that we did, we would have been uh - criticized very, very uh - severely for sitting back and not moving."
3293,-3,-1,Let me assure you that we made every possible overture to the People's Republic of China and through them to the Cambodian Government.
3294,-3,1,We made uh - diplomatic uh - protests to the Cambodian government through the United Nations.
3295,-3,-1,Every possible diplomatic means was utilized.
3296,-3,-1,"But at the same time, I had a responsibility, and so did the National Security Coun- Council, to meet the problem at hand."
3297,-3,-1,And we handled it responsibly and I think Captain Miller's testimony to that effect is the best evidence.
3300,-3,-1,I think the American people have only one - uh requirement - that the facts about Mayaguez be given to them accurately and completely.
3301,-3,0,Mr. Ford has been there for eighteen months.
3302,-3,1,He had the facts that were released today immediately after the Mayaguez incident.
3304,-3,1,"Mr. Ford has said, I believe, that it was accurate, and that the White House made no attempt to block the issuing of that report."
3305,-3,-1,I don't know if that's exactly accurate or not.
3306,-3,1,"I understand that both the - the uh - Department of State and the Defense Department have approved the accuracy of today's report, or yesterday's report, and also the National Security Agency."
3307,-3,-1,"I don't know what was right, or what was wrong, or what was done."
3309,-3,-1,This is uh - what the American people want.
3310,-3,-1,"When something happens that endangers our security, or when something happens that threatens our stature in the world, or when American people are endangered by the actions of a foreign country, uh - just forty uh sailors on the Mayaguez, we obviously have to move aggressively and quickly to rescue them."
3316,-3,1,This is the first time that I've - remember in the history of our country when we've let a foreign country circumvent or change our Bill of Rights.
3317,-3,-1,I'll do everything I can as president to stop the boycott of American businesses by the Arab countries.
3318,-3,-1,It's not a matter of diplomacy or trade with me.
3320,-3,-1,"And I don't believe that Arab countries will pursue it when we have a strong president who will protect the integrity of our country, the commitment of our Constitution and Bill of Rights and protect people in this country who happen to be Jews."
3325,-3,-1,Again Governor Carter is inaccurate.
3327,-3,1,"And in November of 1975 I was the first president to order the executive branch to take action, affirmative action, through the Department of Commerce and other cabinet departments, to make certain that no American businessman or business organization should discriminate against Jews because of an Arab boycott."
3328,-3,1,And I might add that uh - my administration - and I'm very proud of it - is the first administration that has taken an antitrust action against companies in this country that have allegedly cooperated with the Arab boycott.
3329,-3,1,Just on Monday of this week I signed a tax bill that included an amendment that would prevent companies in the United States from taking a tax deduction if they have in any way whatsoever cooperated with the Arab boycott.
3336,-3,-1,Let me restate uh - our policy.
3337,-3,1,"As long as Vietnam, North Vietnam, does not give us a full and complete accounting of our missing in action, I will never uh - go along with the admission of Vietnam to the United Nations."
3341,-3,1,"One of the uh - most embarrassing uh - failures of the Ford administration, and one that touches specifically on human rights, is his refusal to appoint a presidential commission to go to Vietnam, to go to Laos, to go to Cambodia and try to trade for the release of information about those who are missing in action in those wars."
3343,-3,1,"So far, Mr. Ford has not done it."
3347,-3,-1,"I would never normalize relationships with Vietnam, nor permit them to join the United Nations until they've taken this action."
3356,-3,-1,This election will also determine what kind of world we leave our children.
3357,-3,1,"Will it be a nightmare world threatened with the proliferation of atomic bombs, not just in five major countries but dozens of smaller countries that have been permitted to develop atomic weapons because of a failure of our top leadership to stop proliferation?"
3358,-3,-1,"Will we have a world of hunger and - and hatred, and will we be living in an armed camp stripped of our friendship and allies hiding behind a tight defense that's been drawn in around us because we are fearful of the outside world?"
3359,-3,-1,Will we have a government of secrecy that excludes the American people from participation in making basic decisions and therefore covers up mistakes and makes it possible for our government - our government - to depart from the principles of our Constitution and Bill of Rights?
3360,-3,-1,"Or will we have a world of peace with the threat of atomic weapons eliminated, with full trade, with our people at work, inflation controlled, openness in government, our people proud once again, Congress, citizens, president, secretary of state working in harmony and unity toward a common future?"
3361,-3,-1,Or world where people have enough to eat and a world where we care about those who don't?
3362,-3,-1,Can we become a breadbasket of the world instead of the arms merchant of the world?
3363,-3,-1,I believe we can and we ought to.
3364,-3,-1,Now we've been hurt in recent years in this country.
3368,-3,-1,I wanna see our nation - return to a posture and an image and a standard to make us proud once again.
3370,-3,-1,Why can't we have that once again?
3371,-3,-1,"We ought to be a beacon for nations who search for peace and who search for freedom, who search for individual liberty, who search for basic human rights."
3373,-3,-1,We can be once again.
3375,-3,-1,It ought not to be a strength of bombast and threats.
3376,-3,-1,"It ought to be a quiet strength based on the integrity of our people, the vision of the Constitution, an in- innate strong will and purpose that God's given us in the greatest nation on earth - the United States."
3379,-3,-1,"We can debate methods, we can debate one decision or another, but there are two uh things which cannot be debated - experience and results."
3386,-3,-1,"Thank you, and good night."
3424,-3,-1,I can't think of a more important time for us to talk about the future of the country.
3433,-3,1,And I've put forward a series of proposals that make sure that we protect taxpayers as we engage in this important rescue effort.
3452,-3,-1,"But I'm feeling a little better tonight, and I'll tell you why."
3453,-3,1,"Because as we're here tonight in this debate, we are seeing, for the first time in a long time, Republicans and Democrats together, sitting down, trying to work out a solution to this fiscal crisis that we're in."
3456,-3,-1,"We're talking about failures on Main Street, and people who will lose their jobs, and their credits, and their homes, if we don't fix the greatest fiscal crisis, probably in -- certainly in our time, and I've been around a little while."
3468,-3,-1,And we've got a lot of work to do.
3469,-3,-1,And we've got to create jobs.
3470,-3,-1,"And one of the areas, of course, is to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil."
3479,-3,-1,And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there.
3484,-3,-1,"So -- so the question, I think, that we've got to ask ourselves is, yes, we've got to solve this problem short term."
3485,-3,-1,And we are going to have to intervene; there's no doubt about that.
3505,-3,-1,"We've got to start also holding people accountable, and we've got to reward people who succeed."
3512,-3,0,And there are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place.
3533,-3,-1,So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go.
3550,-3,1,"You know, we spent $3 million to study the DNA of bears in Montana."
3559,-3,1,"He has asked for $932 million of earmark pork-barrel spending, nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate."
3560,-3,-1,"I suggest that people go up on the Web site of Citizens Against Government Waste, and they'll look at those projects."
3567,-3,-1,"Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important."
3589,-3,0,"I was called the sheriff, by the -- one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee."
3591,-3,1,"Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs."
3596,-3,-1,I -- I don't know where John is getting his figures.
3605,-3,-1,"And when I'm president, I will go line by line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely."
3614,-3,-1,I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs.
3622,-3,1,"And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork-barrel spending projects."
3625,-3,-1,"I want to double the dividend from $3,500 to $7,000 for every dependent child in America."
3631,-3,1,"And if you make less than $250,000, less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see one dime's worth of tax increase."
3633,-3,1,"Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world."
3636,-3,-1,You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes.
3641,-3,1,Here's the only problem: Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer.
3652,-3,1,"John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion."
3653,-3,-1,You've got to look at our record.
3659,-3,1,"And I've fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it."
3663,-3,1,"He has voted in the United States Senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year."
3680,-3,-1,"Well, there are a range of things that are probably going to have to be delayed."
3704,-3,1,Senator Obama has the most liberal voting record in the United States Senate.
3705,-3,-1,It's hard to reach across the aisle from that far to the left.
3713,-3,-1,"We need very badly to understand that defense spending is very important and vital, particularly in the new challenges we face in the world, but we have to get a lot of the cost overruns under control."
3767,-3,1,"And because of the economy's slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so there's no doubt that as president I'm going to have to make some tough decision."
3775,-3,1,Senator Obama has $800 billion in new spending programs.
3780,-3,1,We owe China $500 billion.
3786,-3,1,"So to stand here and after eight years and say that you're going to lead on controlling spending and, you know, balancing our tax cuts so that they help middle class families when over the last eight years that hasn't happened I think just is, you know, kind of hard to swallow."
3821,-3,-1,"And I wish I had been wrong for the sake of the country and they had been right, but that's not the case."
3823,-3,1,"We have lost over 4,000 lives."
3826,-3,1,"And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government."
3834,-3,1,"Senator Obama said the surge could not work, said it would increase sectarian violence, said it was doomed to failure."
3864,-3,-1,And so my question is...
3875,-3,-1,And you know what they said to us?
3877,-3,0,"They said, let us win."
3882,-3,0,They just passed an electoral...
3885,-3,-1,"There is social, economic progress, and a strategy, a strategy of going into an area, clearing and holding, and the people of the country then become allied with you."
3910,-3,1,Secretary of Defense Robert Gates himself acknowledges the war on terrorism started in Afghanistan and it needs to end there.
3925,-3,0,"Osama bin Laden and General Petraeus have one thing in common that I know of, they both said that Iraq is the central battleground."
3944,-3,1,"And that is a strategic mistake, because every intelligence agency will acknowledge that Al Qaida is the greatest threat against the United States and that Secretary of Defense Gates acknowledged the central front -- that the place where we have to deal with these folks is going to be in Afghanistan and in Pakistan."
3948,-3,0,And I've said this to President Karzai.
3964,-3,-1,"Now, the new president of Pakistan, Kardari (sic), has got his hands full."
3970,-3,-1,It's going to have to be employed in Afghanistan.
3976,-3,1,And the Pakistanis are going to have to understand that that bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad was a signal from the terrorists that they don't want that government to cooperate with us in combating the Taliban and jihadist elements.
3992,-3,-1,This is not an easy situation.
3993,-3,1,You've got cross-border attacks against U.S. troops.
3996,-3,1,"And the problem, John, with the strategy that's been pursued was that, for 10 years, we coddled Musharraf, we alienated the Pakistani population, because we were anti-democratic."
4006,-3,1,"And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldn't make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference."
4015,-3,0,So I have a record.
4018,-3,0,"He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year."
4021,-3,0,"And this was August, a year ago."
4027,-3,-1,And I know how hard it is for that -- for an Army and a military to recover from that.
4032,-3,-1,No U.S. soldier ever dies in vain because they're carrying out the missions of their commander in chief.
4042,-3,-1,"And when I'm president, I will."
4053,-3,-1,"A testimony to you, Jim."
4062,-3,-1,"What I have proposed for a long time, and I've had conversation with foreign leaders about forming a league of democracies, let's be clear and let's have some straight talk."
4067,-3,-1,"So I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior."
4070,-3,1,"What I'd also like to point out the Iranians are putting the most lethal IEDs into Iraq which are killing young Americans, there are special groups in Iran coming into Iraq and are being trained in Iran."
4076,-3,-1,"Well, let me just correct something very quickly."
4095,-3,1,"In each instance, our efforts at isolation have actually accelerated their efforts to get nuclear weapons."
4111,-3,1,"Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran -- guess what -- without precondition."
4116,-3,0,There's a difference between preconditions and preparation.
4137,-3,-1,"If we can't meet with our friends, I don't know how we're going to lead the world in terms of dealing with critical issues like terrorism."
4190,-3,-1,"And at this point, it is absolutely critical for the next president to make clear that we have to follow through on our six-party -- or the six-point cease-fire."
4191,-3,-1,They have to remove themselves from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
4193,-3,-1,"And we also have to affirm all the fledgling democracies in that region, you know, the Estonians, the Lithuanians, the Latvians, the Poles, the Czechs, that we are, in fact, going to be supportive and in solidarity with them in their efforts."
4199,-3,1,"They have not only 15,000 nuclear warheads, but they've got enough to make another 40,000, and some of those loose nukes could fall into the hands of Al Qaida."
4203,-3,-1,"You deal with Russia based on, what are your -- what are the national security interests of the United States of America?"
4208,-3,-1,"Again, a little bit of naivete there."
4211,-3,-1,"I looked into Mr. Putin's eyes, and I saw three letters, a ""K,"" a ""G,"" and a ""B."""
4212,-3,-1,And their aggression in Georgia is not acceptable behavior.
4214,-3,-1,I am sure that that will not happen.
4216,-3,-1,And that wasn't just about a problem between Georgia and Russia.
4241,-3,1,"And, absolutely, I wanted a cessation of the violence, because it put an enormous strain on Georgia, and that's why I was the first to say that we have to rebuild the Georgian economy and called for a billion dollars that has now gone in to help them rebuild."
4245,-3,0,"So back in April, I warned the administration that you had Russian peacekeepers in Georgian territory."
4246,-3,-1,That made no sense whatsoever.
4247,-3,-1,And what we needed to do was replace them with international peacekeepers and a special envoy to resolve the crisis before it boiled over.
4249,-3,-1,"But had it been done, it's possible we could have avoided the issue."
4252,-3,0,"That means that we, as one of the biggest consumers of oil -- 25 percent of the world's oil -- have to have an energy strategy not just to deal with Russia, but to deal with many of the rogue states we've talked about, Iran, Venezuela."
4253,-3,1,"And that means, yes, increasing domestic production and off-shore drilling, but we only have 3 percent of the world's oil supplies and we use 25 percent of the world's oil."
4271,-3,-1,And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge.
4273,-3,-1,"And it will have, I think, an important effect on the price of a barrel of oil."
4274,-3,-1,"I just have to respond very quickly, just to correct -- just to correct the record."
4284,-3,0,"And, Senator McCain, he says -- he talks about Arizona."
4305,-3,0,"And I want to tell you that one of the things I'm most proud of, among others, because I have worked across the aisle."
4322,-3,-1,And I think that those men and women in those agencies are doing a great job.
4325,-3,-1,"Well, first of all, I think that we are safer in some ways."
4355,-3,-1,They would establish a base in Iraq.
4356,-3,-1,"The consequences of defeat, which would result from his plan of withdrawal and according to date certain, regardless of conditions, according to our military leaders, according to every expert, would lead to defeat -- possible defeat, loss of all the fragile sacrifice that we've made of American blood and treasure, which grieves us all."
4358,-3,1,"And General Petraeus says we have had great success, but it's very fragile."
4386,-3,-1,That's been missing over the last eight years.
4399,-3,-1,"But, also, I have the ability, and the knowledge, and the background to make the right judgments, to keep this country safe and secure."
4403,-3,-1,"Well, let me just make a closing point."
4409,-3,-1,"And part of what we need to do, what the next president has to do -- and this is part of our judgment, this is part of how we're going to keep America safe -- is to -- to send a message to the world that we are going to invest in issues like education, we are going to invest in issues that -- that relate to how ordinary people are able to live out their dreams."
5497,-3,-1,Let me just talk to you about one of the short-term fixes.
5500,-3,1,"Now, we have allocated $750 billion."
5504,-3,-1,That paid their mortgage payments?
5508,-3,-1,And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority.
5514,-3,1,And I pushed for some core principles: making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they're putting money up.
5531,-3,-1,We've got to fix our health care system and we've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn.
5543,-3,1,That's 16 million jobs in America.
5547,-3,0,He has been watching ads of Senator McCain's.
5554,-3,1,"If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax."
5556,-3,1,"And 95 percent of working families, 95 percent of you out there, will get a tax cut."
5557,-3,1,"In fact, independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle-class families than Senator McCain does."
5564,-3,-1,"You know, when Senator Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around."
5569,-3,1,"I want small businesses -- and by the way, the small businesses that we're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now."
5576,-3,1,"Number one, I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans."
5578,-3,-1,We're talking about Joe the plumber.
5580,-3,1,"Then Exxon Mobil, which made $12 billion, record profits, over the last several quarters, they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they're trying to figure out how they're going to afford food, how they're going to save for their kids' college education, they need a break."
5585,-3,-1,Let's not raise anybody's taxes.
5588,-3,1,The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world.
5591,-3,-1,Where are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business?
5615,-3,1,"What I want to emphasize, though, is that I have been a strong proponent of pay-as- you-go."
5658,-3,1,"I have fought against -- well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program."
5659,-3,-1,Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.
5663,-3,1,"I saved the taxpayer $6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years, as you might recall, that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer, DOD, and people ended up in jail."
5667,-3,1,... including $3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown.
5679,-3,1,Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget.
5681,-3,-1,But it's not going to solve the problem.
5682,-3,-1,"Now, the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history, just so that we understand what we're doing going forward."
5684,-3,1,It has doubled over the last eight years.
5697,-3,-1,I'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country.
5700,-3,-1,"Of course, we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget."
5705,-3,-1,I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will...
5715,-3,1,I have fought against spending.
5725,-3,0,Doesn't make me popular with the teachers union.
5748,-3,-1,Whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 Commission.
5749,-3,1,I have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate.
5751,-3,-1,"Senator Obama, your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party isn't very convincing."
5761,-3,-1,It's been a very tough campaign.
5765,-3,-1,"And the fact is, it's gotten pretty tough."
5772,-3,-1,"I hope that Senator Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis, very unfair and totally inappropriate."
5775,-3,1,And it's a matter of fact that Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.
5785,-3,1,"And 100 percent, John, of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative."
5789,-3,0,"And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we're having tonight about health care, about energy policy, about tax policy."
5794,-3,1,"Senator McCain's own campaign said publicly last week that, if we keep on talking about the economic crisis, we lose, so we need to change the subject."
5795,-3,-1,"And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy, devoted to talking about health care, devoted to talking about energy, and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college."
5798,-3,0,"Well, if you'll turn on the television, as I -- I watched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday."
5817,-3,-1,You've got to read what he said.
5826,-3,0,"We can have serious differences about our health care policy, for example, John, because we do have a difference on health care policy, but we..."
5834,-3,-1,Let me just say categorically I'm proud of the people that come to our rallies.
5840,-3,-1,"In fact, some T-shirts that are very..."
5843,-3,1,"So the point is -- the point is that I have repudiated every time someone's been out of line, whether they've been part of my campaign or not, and I will continue to do that."
5844,-3,-1,But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on.
5846,-3,-1,"Well, look, Bob, as I said..."
5852,-3,-1,And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable.
5855,-3,-1,And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long.
5870,-3,-1,So let's get the record straight.
5875,-3,0,"Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois, the president of Northwestern University, who happens to be a Republican, the president of The Chicago Tribune, a Republican- leaning newspaper."
5912,-3,1,That's what he's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up.
5916,-3,-1,"So, on the key issues that are of importance to American families, Joe Biden's always been on the right side, and I think he will make an outstanding president if, heaven forbid, something happened to me."
5918,-3,0,"Well, Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin."
5934,-3,-1,And she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process.
5935,-3,-1,And I can't tell how proud I am of her and her family.
5951,-3,1,"In Iraq, he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries."
5983,-3,-1,And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face.
5989,-3,-1,And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil.
5991,-3,1,"That's why I've focused on putting resources into solar, wind, biodiesel, geothermal."
5997,-3,1,And NAFTA doesn't have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements.
6003,-3,-1,That is not free trade.
6007,-3,-1,And you really have to pay attention to words.
6012,-3,-1,We've got to do it now.
6017,-3,1,I am a free trader.
6021,-3,1,"Because of previous agreements, their goods and products come into our country for free."
6026,-3,-1,But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.
6029,-3,1,The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions.
6033,-3,-1,"When I talked about the automakers, they are obviously getting hammered right now."
6038,-3,1,It's going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption.
6041,-3,1,"Free trade between ourselves and Colombia, I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement, a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States, opening up those markets."
6043,-3,1,"And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover, and we went from a deep recession into a depression."
6044,-3,-1,We're not going to follow that path while I'm -- when I'm president of the United States.
6048,-3,1,"We've got to do both, and that's exactly what my plan does."
6056,-3,1,"If you've got health insurance through your employer, you can keep your health insurance, keep your choice of doctor, keep your plan."
6058,-3,1,"And we estimate we can cut the average family's premium by about $2,500 per year."
6061,-3,-1,We'll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs.
6062,-3,-1,We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient.
6065,-3,-1,"This will cost some money on the front end, but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy, but it's also how we're going to save the federal budget, because we can't afford these escalating costs."
6068,-3,-1,"Well, it is a terribly painful situation for Americans."
6077,-3,-1,We need to have more community health centers.
6082,-3,-1,We -- we need to have -- we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness.
6088,-3,1,"Senator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through -- as he said, his object is a single payer system."
6102,-3,1,I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty.
6105,-3,1,"Right now, what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system, which taxpayers pick up, or they're going to the emergency room for uncompensated care, which everybody picks up in their premiums."
6109,-3,-1,"In fact, what, Joe, if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance, we'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it."
6111,-3,0,"Now, what we haven't talked about is Senator McCain's plan."
6115,-3,1,"Here's the problem -- that for about 20 million people, you may find yourselves no longer having employer-based health insurance."
6116,-3,1,"This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $5,000, young and healthy folks."
6127,-3,1,"Now, Joe, you're rich, congratulations, and you will then fall into the category where you'll have to pay a fine if you don't provide health insurance that Senator Obama mandates, not the kind that you think is best for your family, your children, your employees, but the kind that he mandates for you."
6134,-3,-1,"This will give them a chance to choose their own futures, not have Senator Obama and government decide that for them."
6136,-3,1,"If you notice that in all of this proposal, Senator -- government wants -- Senator Obama wants government to do the job."
6150,-3,1,"Now, under Senator McCain's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer-based health care."
6153,-3,1,"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which generally doesn't support a lot of Democrats, said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer-based health care system."
6166,-3,-1,I thought it was a bad decision.
6167,-3,-1,I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad.
6174,-3,0,You were offered a chance to join.
6176,-3,1,I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg.
6182,-3,-1,They should be judged on their qualifications.
6185,-3,-1,And not legislating from the bench.
6191,-3,-1,"Well, I think it's true that we shouldn't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people."
6195,-3,-1,But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided.
6199,-3,-1,So this is going to be an important issue.
6200,-3,-1,"I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record, who have the intellect, and who hopefully have a sense of what real-world folks are going through."
6201,-3,-1,I'll just give you one quick example.
6203,-3,1,"For years, she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job."
6211,-3,-1,It was a trial lawyer's dream.
6212,-3,-1,Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue.
6221,-3,-1,"I don't know how you vote ""present"" on some of that."
6231,-3,1,"The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment, which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it."
6233,-3,1,"Their Hippocratic Oath would have required them to provide care, and there was already a law in the books."
6238,-3,-1,"This is an issue that -- look, it divides us."
6239,-3,-1,"And in some ways, it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views."
6242,-3,-1,I think it's always a tragic situation.
6254,-3,-1,But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn.
6256,-3,-1,"Of course, we have to work together, and, of course, it's vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision, with a compassion, that we'll help them with the adoptive services, with the courage to bring that child into this world and we'll help take care of it."
6264,-3,0,"This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication, because there's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power."
6269,-3,-1,"I think it's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers, an army of new teachers, especially in math and science, give them higher pay, give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability."
6271,-3,1,"Right now, I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they're going to college, they are taking on $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $60,000 worth of debt, and it's very difficult for them to go into some fields, like basic research in science, for example, thinking to themselves that they're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house."
6275,-3,-1,We can't do it just in the schools.
6284,-3,0,"And we have to be able to give parents the same choice, frankly, that Senator Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice."
6288,-3,1,You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student.
6299,-3,-1,But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do.
6301,-3,1,He put forward No Child Left Behind.
6304,-3,-1,"So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education, providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support."
6306,-3,1,"Charter schools, I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions."
6313,-3,-1,And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize.
6324,-3,0,"That was vouchers, Senator Obama."
6325,-3,-1,And I'm frankly surprised you didn't pay more attention to that example.
6333,-3,1,By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program aren't any better off than the others.
6336,-3,-1,"That was, of course, out-of-bounds by the Democrats."
6343,-3,-1,"And we'll find and we'll spend the money, research, to find the cause of autism."
6349,-3,-1,"And I've got to tell you that vouchers, where they are requested and where they are agreed to, are a good and workable system."
6357,-3,1,"But the -- but here's the thing, is that, even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots."
6371,-3,-1,I think we've had a very healthy discussion.
6375,-3,-1,We cannot be satisfied with what we've been doing for the last eight years.
6376,-3,1,"I have a record of reform, and taking on my party, the other party, the special interests, whether it be an HMO Patients' Bill of Rights, or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in -- in this country, or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 Commission, I have a long record of it."
6378,-3,-1,We have to make health care affordable and available.
6379,-3,-1,"We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens, not just the privileged few."
6381,-3,-1,"We have to stop the spending, which has mortgaged your children's futures."
6383,-3,-1,"That's why I've asked you not only to examine my record, but my proposals for the future of this country."
6384,-3,0,I've spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first.
6386,-3,-1,And I hope you'll give me an opportunity to serve again.
6389,-3,-1,"Well, I want to thank Senator McCain and Bob for moderating."
6393,-3,-1,"We need fundamental change in this country, and that's what I'd like to bring."
6394,-3,-1,"You know, over the last 20 months, you've invited me into your homes."
6395,-3,0,You've shared your stories with me.
6400,-3,-1,In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class.
6404,-3,-1,It's not going to be quick.
6407,-3,-1,"I would ask for your vote, and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president, I will work every single day, tirelessly, on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children."
6452,-3,-1,We're proud to be here.
6453,-3,-1,"Mr. President, I'm glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the American people."
6454,-3,-1,Will we ever be safe and secure again?
6462,-3,-1,The measurement is: Are we as safe as we ought to be?
6466,-3,1,"People who fly on airplanes today, the cargo hold is not X-rayed, but the baggage is."
6471,-3,-1,"I can do a better job of waging a smarter, more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists."
6473,-3,-1,We'll do whatever is necessary to be safe.
6474,-3,-1,"But I pledge this to you, America: I will do it in the way that Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy and others did, where we build the strongest alliances, where the world joins together, where we have the best intelligence and where we are able, ultimately, to be more safe and secure."
6477,-3,-1,I want to thank Arizona State as well.
6480,-3,0,"As a result of securing ourselves and ridding the Taliban out of Afghanistan, the Afghan people had elections this weekend."
6481,-3,1,And the first voter was a 19-year-old woman.
6487,-3,-1,I think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous.
6488,-3,-1,I don't think you can secure America for the long run if you don't have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people.
6490,-3,1,I signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources.
6516,-3,1,"Bob, we relied upon a company out of England to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the United States citizen, and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated."
6520,-3,-1,"Help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot, the elderly and the young."
6521,-3,0,"The CDC, responsible for health in the United States, is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly."
6524,-3,1,"Vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued, and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine."
6525,-3,-1,One of the reasons I'm such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people aren't afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law.
6532,-3,1,"You've got about a million right here in Arizona, just shy, 950,000, who have no health insurance at all."
6533,-3,1,"82,000 Arizonians lost their health insurance under President Bush's watch."
6534,-3,1,"223,000 kids in Arizona have no health insurance at all."
6535,-3,1,"All across our country -- go to Ohio, 1.4 million Ohioans have no health insurance, 114,000 of them lost it under President Bush; Wisconsin, 82,000 Wisconsinites lost it under President Bush."
6559,-3,0,I choose Blue Cross/Blue Shield.
6576,-3,1,He's the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years; the only president to see exports go down; the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today.
6577,-3,-1,"Now, I'm going to reverse that."
6581,-3,1,"And we start -- we don't do it exclusively -- but we start by rolling back George Bush's unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people, people earning more than $200,000 a year, and we pass, hopefully, the McCain-Kerry Commission which identified some $60 billion that we can get."
6595,-3,1,He voted to increase taxes 98 times.
6604,-3,-1,"I propose a detailed budget, Bob."
6613,-3,-1,And here's some help for you to go get an education.
6614,-3,-1,Here's some help for you to go to a community college.
6615,-3,1,We've expanded trade adjustment assistance.
6616,-3,-1,We want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century.
6623,-3,0,And so we said: Let's raise the standards.
6626,-3,-1,Education is how to make sure we've got a workforce that's productive and competitive.
6631,-3,0,I want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally.
6638,-3,1,The wages of Americans have gone down.
6639,-3,1,"The jobs that are being created in Arizona right now are paying about $13,700 less than the jobs that we're losing."
6640,-3,-1,And the president just walks on by this problem.
6644,-3,1,They've cut the Pell Grants and the Perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college.
6646,-3,1,They've wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed.
6655,-3,-1,I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it.
6666,-3,-1,"And when I'm president, we're going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and we're going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in America for all corporations, 5 percent."
6678,-3,-1,"And if we do that, we can have an impact."
6684,-3,-1,In his last litany of misstatements.
6688,-3,0,"You know, he talks to the workers."
6691,-3,1,"If you have a child, you got a $1,000 child credit."
6695,-3,1,We created a 10 percent bracket to help lower-income Americans.
6709,-3,1,"I broke with my party in order to balance the budget, and Ronald Reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for."
6716,-3,1,We have more people who qualify.
6732,-3,-1,It's important that we do that.
6742,-3,-1,I'm deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the United States.
6752,-3,-1,"I think if you talk to anybody, it's not choice."
6761,-3,-1,You can't disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital.
6778,-3,-1,"Now, I will not allow somebody to come in and change Roe v. Wade."
6783,-3,0,"Now, with respect to religion, you know, as I said, I grew up a Catholic."
6789,-3,0,"There's a great passage of the Bible that says, ""What does it mean, my brother, to say you have faith if there are no deeds?"
6806,-3,-1,It made a lot of sense.
6812,-3,-1,All of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion.
6831,-3,-1,It's one of the reasons I'm a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts.
6835,-3,-1,"Secondly, I do believe the lawsuits -- I don't believe, I know -- that the lawsuits are causing health-care costs to rise in America."
6839,-3,1,"Thirdly, one of the reasons why there's still high cost in medicine is because this is -- they don't use any information technology."
6845,-3,-1,"People tell me that when the health-care field is fully integrated with information technology, it'll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system."
6851,-3,1,In the Senate we passed the right of Americans to import drugs from Canada.
6860,-3,1,"Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty."
6863,-3,1,That's a large part of your 17 percent increase in Medicare premiums.
6865,-3,-1,"Now, we also have people sicker because they don't have health insurance."
6867,-3,-1,We got to have health care for all Americans.
6896,-3,-1,I don't force you to do anything.
6897,-3,0,It's not a government plan.
6902,-3,1,"You can keep what you have today, keep a high deductible, keep high premiums, keep a high co-pay, keep low benefits."
6906,-3,1,"And in exchange, if the states want to -- they're not forced to, they can choose to -- they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty."
6909,-3,1,"We allow you -- if you choose to, you don't have to -- but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves."
6919,-3,-1,And I'm going to offer it to America.
6922,-3,-1,"Anyway, let me quote the Lewin report."
6928,-3,1,"If you raise the Medicaid to 300 percent, it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees."
6930,-3,1,It's estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance.
6932,-3,-1,"I think government- run health will lead to poor-quality health, will lead to rationing, will lead to less choice."
6933,-3,-1,"Once a health-care program ends up in a line item in the federal government budget, it leads to more controls."
6934,-3,-1,And just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care.
6944,-3,0,I have Blue Cross/Blue Shield.
6961,-3,0,"I remember the 2000 campaign, people said if George W. gets elected, your check will be taken away."
6969,-3,0,"It was a committee chaired by the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a Democrat."
6973,-3,-1,I will work with Republicans and Democrats.
6982,-3,1,And the CBO said -- that's the Congressional Budget Office; it's bipartisan -- they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent.
6985,-3,1,Not one of them are paid for.
6995,-3,-1,I will not cut the benefits.
7009,-3,1,If you take the tax cut that the president of the United States has given -- President Bush gave to Americans in the top 1 percent of America -- just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of America would have saved Social Security until the year 2075.
7010,-3,1,The president decided to give it to the wealthiest Americans in a tax cut.
7022,-3,1,"Eleven other presidents -- six Democrats and five Republicans -- had wars, had recessions, had great difficulties; none of them lost jobs the way this president has."
7024,-3,-1,"And if we're fiscally responsible and put America back to work, we're going to fix Social Security."
7030,-3,1,That's exactly where the tax cuts went.
7047,-3,1,We added 1.9 million new jobs over the last 13 months.
7063,-3,1,We're increasing the border security of the United States.
7067,-3,-1,And we'll continue to do so over the next four years.
7072,-3,-1,"If you can make 50 cents in the heart of Mexico, for example, or make $5 here in America, $5.15, you're going to come here if you're worth your salt, if you want to put food on the table for your families."
7085,-3,-1,"If they want to become a citizen, they can stand in line, too."
7087,-3,1,"In September 2003, he supported amnesty for illegal aliens."
7106,-3,-1,"And thirdly, we need an earned-legalization program for people who have been here for a long time, stayed out of trouble, got a job, paid their taxes, and their kids are American."
7107,-3,-1,"We got to start moving them toward full citizenship, out of the shadows."
7113,-3,-1,That is an outrageous claim.
7138,-3,1,The minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years.
7139,-3,1,"If we raise the minimum wage, which I will do over several years to $7 an hour, 9.2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another $3,800 a year."
7140,-3,1,"The president has denied 9.2 million women $3,800 a year, but he doesn't hesitate to fight for $136,000 to a millionaire."
7144,-3,1,Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do.
7165,-3,-1,And guess who would get shuffled through?
7170,-3,0,"I remember a lady in Houston, Texas, told me, ""Reading is the new civil right,"" and she's right."
7172,-3,-1,"You see, we'll never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesn't quit on children, an education system that raises standards, an education that makes sure there's excellence in every classroom."
7191,-3,-1,So I don't intend to see it undone.
7193,-3,-1,But let me go a step further.
7207,-3,0,He talked about the unemployed.
7216,-3,-1,"Now, that's not in my gut."
7232,-3,-1,"One way or the other, they're wrapped up in it."
7233,-3,1,"Now, I've proposed adding two active-duty divisions to the armed forces of the United States -- one combat, one support."
7237,-3,-1,We ought to be doing that.
7257,-3,0,In our first debate he proposed America pass a global test.
7268,-3,-1,No nation will ever have a veto over us.
7270,-3,-1,"That's how you gain legitimacy with your own countrypeople, and that's how you gain legitimacy in the world."
7279,-3,1,"I did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban, and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move, because Republicans and Democrats were against the assault weapon ban, people of both parties."
7280,-3,-1,I believe law-abiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun.
7282,-3,-1,But the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns.
7292,-3,1,And I respect the Second Amendment and I will not tamper with the Second Amendment.
7301,-3,0,"I was hunting in Iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there, and he pointed to a house in back of us, and said, ""See the house over?"
7302,-3,1,"We just did a drug bust a week earlier, and the guy we arrested had an AK-47 lying on the bed right beside him. """
7306,-3,-1,It encouraged them to do it.
7307,-3,-1,So I believe America's less safe.
7318,-3,0,I was chairman of it once.
7323,-3,-1,They've tried to undo them.
7324,-3,-1,"The fact is that in too many parts of our country, we still have discrimination."
7328,-3,-1,"I think that we have a long way to go, regrettably."
7330,-3,0,"During the Clinton years, as you may recall, there was a fight over affirmative action."
7332,-3,0,"So we had a policy called ""Mend it, don't end it."
7335,-3,-1,"As president, I will make certain we travel it."
7341,-3,-1,"I see that as part of my job as president, and I'll make my best effort to do it."
7344,-3,0,I met with the Black Congressional Caucus at the White House.
7350,-3,-1,"That's the access I believe is necessary, is to make sure every child learns to read, write, add and subtract early, to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma."
7392,-3,-1,Everything is a gift from the Almighty.
7397,-3,1,We have a separate and unequal school system in the United States of America.
7412,-3,-1,"And I really was moved, as well as impressed, by the speech that he gave to the Congress."
7413,-3,-1,"And I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans, we were all just Americans."
7417,-3,-1,I've never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States.
7424,-3,0,"Over 20 years in the United States Senate, I've worked with John McCain, who's sitting here, I've worked with other colleagues."
7430,-3,-1,My biggest disappointment in Washington is how partisan the town is.
7436,-3,-1,"And the way I view it is there's a lot of entrenched special interests there, people who are, you know, on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue, and they dig in."
7457,-3,0,"I tell the people on the campaign trail, when I asked Laura to marry me, she said, ""Fine, just so long as I never have to give a speech."
7459,-3,-1,"Fortunately, she didn't hold me to that deal."
7464,-3,-1,I can't tell you how lucky I am.
7473,-3,-1,"Well, I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up."
7481,-3,0,"And she looked at me from her hospital bed and she just looked at me and she said, ""Remember: integrity, integrity, integrity."
7490,-3,0,"I've watched him with the first lady, who I admire a great deal, and his daughters."
7501,-3,-1,And I believe that we can together do things that are within the grasp of Americans.
7505,-3,-1,We can further the cause of equality in our nation.
7508,-3,-1,"And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher."
7509,-3,-1,I believe we can do better.
7514,-3,-1,"I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and, most of all, to be safer forever."
7519,-3,0,"In the Oval Office, there's a painting by a friend of Laura and mine named -- by Tom Lee."
7520,-3,0,"And it's a West Texas painting, a painting of a mountain scene."
7528,-3,1,"And yet, because of the hard work of the American people and good policies, this economy is growing."
7582,-3,-1,"As I look at Cuba today, I believe that we are following the right course, a course which is difficult but a course which under the circumstance is the only proper one which will see that the Cuban people get a chance to realize their aspirations of progress through freedom and that they get that with our cooperation with the other organi- of the states in the Organization of American States."
7584,-3,0,He points to the fact that I visited Cuba while Mr. Batista was in power there.
7588,-3,-1,We think that's pretty good progress.
7589,-3,1,Senator Kennedy also indicated with regard to Cuba that he thought that I had made a mistake when I was in Cuba in not calling for free elections in that country.
7592,-3,1,And that position is that the United States has a treaty - a treaty with all of the Organization of American States - which prohibits us from interfering in the internal affairs of any other state and prohibits them as well.
7594,-3,-1,"Now with regard to Cuba, let me make one thing clear."
7595,-3,-1,There isn't any question but that we will defend our rights there.
7597,-3,-1,There also isn't any question but that the free people of Cuba - the people who want to be free - are going to be supported and that they will attain their freedom.
7598,-3,-1,"No, Cuba is not lost, and I don't think this kind of defeatist talk by Senator Kennedy helps the situation one bit."
7601,-3,0,In my speech last night I indicated that I thought that Cuba one day again would be free.
7602,-3,1,"Where I've been critical of the Administration's policy, and where I criticized Mr. Nixon, was because in his press conference in Havana in 1955, he praised the competence and stability of the bicta- bict- Batista dictatorship - that dictatorship had killed over twenty thousand Cubans in seven years."
7603,-3,-1,"Secondly, I did not criticize him for not calling for free elections."
7605,-3,1,"Thirdly, Arthur Gardner, a Republican Ambassador, Earl Smith, a Republican Ambassador, in succession - both have indicated in the past six weeks that they reported to Washington that Castro was a Marxist, that Raul Castro was a Communist, and that they got no effective results."
7607,-3,1,"I hope some day it will rise; but I don't think it will rise if we continue the same policies toward Cuba that we did in recent years, and in fact towards all of Latin America - when we've almost ignored the needs of Latin America; we've beamed not a single Voice of America program in Spanish to all of Latin America in the last eight years, except for the three months of the Hungarian uh - revolution."
7613,-3,-1,In my judgment that statement has been distorted uh - by Mr. Nixon and others in their debates around the country and in their discussions.
7615,-3,-1,The U-2 flights were proper from the point of view of protecting our security.
7617,-3,1,"And I said that I felt that rather than tell the lie which we told, rather than indicate that the flights would continue - in fact, I believe Mr. Nixon himself said on May fifteenth that the flights would continue even though Mr. Herter testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that they had been canceled as of May twelfth - that it would have been far better that if we had expressed regrets, if that would have saved the summit, and if the summit is useful - and I believe it is."
7619,-3,1,We expressed regrets for a flight over Eastern Germany under this Administration.
7627,-3,-1,I believe we should have a stronger military force.
7628,-3,-1,I believe we should increase our strength all over the world.
7631,-3,-1,I think Kenne- Senator Kennedy is wrong on three counts.
7635,-3,-1,The United States is a strong country.
7636,-3,-1,"Whenever we do anything that's wrong, we can express regrets."
7639,-3,-1,This seems to me is criticism that again is wrong on his part.
7640,-3,-1,We all remember Pearl Harbor.
7641,-3,1,We lost three thousand American lives.
7642,-3,-1,We cannot afford an intelligence gap.
7643,-3,-1,And I just want to make my position absolutely clear with regard to getting intelligence information.
7644,-3,-1,"I don't intend to see to it that the United States is ever in a position where, while we're negotiating with the Soviet Union, that we discontinue our intelligence effort."
7645,-3,-1,And I don't intend ever to express regrets to Mr. Khrushchev or anybody else if I'm doing something that has the support of the Congress and that is right for the purpose of protecting the security of the United States.
7651,-3,1,"And there we would give statutory authority to the Committee on Government Contracts, which is an effective way of getting real progress made in this area, since about one out of every four jobs is held by and is allotted by people who have government contracts."
7654,-3,1,That of course was rejected as was the government contracts provision by the special session of the Congress to - in which Mr. Kennedy was quite active.
7655,-3,-1,"And then as far as other areas are concerned, I think that we have to look to presidential leadership."
7656,-3,-1,"And when I speak of presidential leadership, I refer for example to our attitude on the sit-in strikes."
7658,-3,0,I have talked to Negro mothers.
7660,-3,-1,"This is wrong, and we have to do something about it."
7663,-3,-1,"Now there are other places where the executive can lead, but let me just sum up by saying this: why do I talk every time I'm in the South on civil rights?"
7664,-3,-1,Not because I am preaching to the people of the South because this isn't just a Southern problem; it's a Northern problem and a Western problem; it's a problem for all of us.
7667,-3,-1,"And so I say both the candidates and both the vice presidential candidates, I would hope as well - including Senator Johnson - should talk on this issue at every opportunity."
7669,-3,-1,"Well, Mr. Nixon hasn't discussed the two basic questions: what is going to be done and what will be his policy on implementing the Supreme Court decision of 1954?"
7670,-3,-1,Giving aid to schools technically that are trying to carry out the decision is not the great question.
7671,-3,-1,"Secondly, what's he going to do to provide fair employment?"
7672,-3,0,"He's been the head of the Committee on Government Contracts that's carried out two cases, both in the District of Columbia."
7675,-3,-1,These are the great questions: equality of education in school.
7676,-3,1,"About two percent of our population of white people are - is illiterate, ten per cent of our colored population."
7677,-3,1,Sixty to seventy percent of our colored children do not finish high school.
7678,-3,-1,"These are the questions in these areas that the North and South, East and West are entitled to know."
7679,-3,-1,What will be the leadership of the president in these areas to provide equality of opportunity for employment?
7681,-3,-1,What will be done to provide equality of education in all sections of the United States?
7682,-3,-1,Those are the questions to which the president must establish a moral tone and moral leadership.
7683,-3,-1,And I can assure you that if I'm elected president we will do so.
7687,-3,-1,"From the standpoint of MR, KENNEDY: Well let me say that I think that the president operates in a number of different areas."
7690,-3,-1,"Secondly, as an executive leader."
7691,-3,1,There have been only six cases brought by this Attorney General under the voting bill passed in 1957 and the voting bill passed in 1960.
7692,-3,-1,The right to vote is basic.
7693,-3,1,I do not believe that this Administration has implemented those bills which represent the will of the majority of the Congress on two occasions with vigor.
7695,-3,-1,Everyone who does business with the government should have the opportunity to make sure that they do not practice discrimination in their hiring.
7697,-3,-1,"And then fourthly, as a moral leader."
7698,-3,-1,There is a very strong moral basis for this concept of equality of opportunity.
7700,-3,-1,We need all the talent we can get.
7701,-3,-1,We sit on a conspicuous stage.
7703,-3,-1,We have to practice what we preach.
7704,-3,-1,We set a very high standard for ourselves.
7707,-3,-1,"We preach in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution, in the statement of our greatest leaders, we preach very high standards; and if we're not going to be s- charged before the world with hypocrisy we have to meet those standards."
7708,-3,-1,I believe the president of the United States should indicate it.
7711,-3,-1,I would have hoped that it would have been possible to use marshals to do so.
7713,-3,-1,I would hope an incident like that would not happen.
7714,-3,-1,"I think if the president is responsible, if he consults with those involved, if he makes it clear that the Supreme Court decision is going to be carried out in a way that the Supreme Court planned - with deliberate speed - then in my judgment, providing he's behind action, I believe we can make uh - progress."
7717,-3,-1,And I believe on this great moral issue he should speak out and give his views clearly.
7719,-3,-1,"Senator Kennedy has expressed some hopes in this field, hopes which I think all Americans would share who want some problem - some progress in this area."
7720,-3,-1,But let's look at the performance.
7721,-3,1,"When he selected his vice presidential running mate, he selected a man who had voted against most of these proposals and who opposes them at the present time."
7725,-3,-1,And yet that very committee of which I am chairman has been handicapped by the fact that we have not had adequate funds; we have not had adequate powers; we haven't had an adequate staff.
7726,-3,1,"Now in the special session of Congress and also in the session that preceded it, the Democratic Congress - in which there's a two-to-one Democratic majority - was asked by the President to give us the funds and give us the power to do a job and they did nothing at all, And in the special session in which Senator Kennedy was calling the signals, along with Senator Johnson, they turned it down and he himself voted against giving us the powers despite the fact that the bill had already been considered before, that it already had hearings on, and the Congress already knew what it had before it."
7727,-3,-1,All that I can say is this: what we need here are not just high hopes.
7728,-3,-1,What we need is action.
7729,-3,-1,"And in the field of executive leadership, I can say that I believe it's essential that the president of the United States not only set the tone but he also must lead; he must act as he talks."
7733,-3,-1,"Mr. Morgan, no matter how well we're doing in the cold war, we're not doing as well as we should."
7735,-3,-1,"Now as far as the present situation is concerned, I think it's time that we nail a few of these distortions about the United States that have been put out."
7744,-3,-1,Look at the votes in the United Nations over the past seven and a half years.
7745,-3,-1,That's a test of prestige.
7746,-3,1,"Every time the United States has been an one side and they've been on the other side, our position has been sustained."
7751,-3,-1,What tools do we need to fight us?
7752,-3,-1,"Well we need, for example, economic assistance; we need technical assistance; we need exchange; we need programs of diplomatic and other character which will be effective in that area."
7754,-3,1,"I'd like to point out that in the last six years, the Democratic Congresses, of which he'd been a member, have cut twenty million dollars off of the Voice of America programs."
7755,-3,1,They also have cut four billion dollars off of mutual security in these last six years.
7756,-3,1,They also have cut two billion dollars off of defense.
7757,-3,-1,"Now when they talk about our record here, it is well that they recognize that they have to stand up for their record as well."
7758,-3,-1,So let me summarize by saying this: I'm not satisfied with what we're doing in the cold war because I believe we have to step up our activities and launch an offensive for the minds and hearts and souls of men.
7759,-3,-1,It must be economic; it must be technological; above all it must be ideological.
7760,-3,-1,But we've got to get help from the Congress in order to do this.
7763,-3,1,Nineteen fifty-three we tried to put an appropriation of five billion dollars for our defenses.
7766,-3,-1,"Secondly, on the question of our position in the United Nations."
7768,-3,1,"Thirdly, in 1952, there were only seven votes in favor of the admission of Red China into the United Nations."
7770,-3,-1,We have not maintained our position and our prestige.
7771,-3,1,"A Gallup Poll taken in February of this year asking the - in eight out of nine countries - they asked the people, who do they think would be ahead by 1970 militarily and scientifically, and a majority in eight of the nine countries said the Soviet Union would be by 1970."
7773,-3,1,"The Rockefeller Brothers report, General Ridgway, General Gavin, the Gaither Report, various reports of Congressional committees all indicate that the relative strength of the p- United States both militarily, politically, psychologically, and scientifically and industrially - the relative strength of the so- of United States compared to that of the Soviet Union and the Chinese Communists together - has deteriorated in the last eight years and we should know it, and the American people should be told the facts."
7780,-3,1,"And therefore we passed an authorization - not an aid bill - which was the first time, really, since the Inter-American Bank which was founded a year ago was developed, that we really have looked at the needs of Latin America; that we have associated ourselves with those people."
7781,-3,1,"Secondly, I believe that in the ca- that it's far better for the United States, instead of concentrating our aid, particularly in the underdeveloped world, on surplus military equipment - we poured three hundred million dollars of surplus military equipment into Laos."
7782,-3,1,"We paid more military aid, more aid into Laos po- per - per person than in any country in the world and we ought to know now that Laos is moving from neutralism in the direction of the Communists."
7783,-3,-1,"I believe instead of doing that, we should concentrate our aid in long-term loans which these people can pay back either in hard money or in local currency."
7784,-3,-1,This permits them to maintain their self-respect.
7785,-3,-1,It permits us to make sure that the projects which are invested in are going to produce greater wealth.
7786,-3,-1,And I believe that in cases of India and Africa and Latin America that this is where our emphasis should be.
7787,-3,-1,I would strengthen the Development Loan Fund.
7790,-3,-1,"And unless we're ready to carry out programs like that in the sixties, this battle for economic survival which these people are waging are going to be lost."
7791,-3,1,"And if India should lose her battle, with thirty-five per cent of the people of the underdeveloped world within her borders, then I believe that the balance of power could move against us."
7792,-3,-1,I think the United States can afford to do these things.
7793,-3,-1,I think that we could not afford not to do these things.
7794,-3,-1,This goes to our survival.
7795,-3,-1,"And here in a country which if it is moving ahead, if it's developing its economy to the fullest - which we are not now - in my judgment, we'll have the resources to meet our military commitments and also our commitments overseas."
7796,-3,-1,"I believe it's essential that we do it because in the next ten years the balance of power is going to begin to move in the world from one direction or another - towards us or towards the Communists - and unless we begin to identify ourselves not only with the anti-Communist fight, but also with the fight against poverty and hunger, these people are going to begin to turn to the Communists as an example."
7797,-3,-1,I believe we can do it.
7802,-3,-1,"But it's also tremendously important to bear in mind that when you pour in money without pouring in technical assistance at w- as well, that you have a disastrous situation."
7804,-3,-1,"We also have to have in mind something else with regard to this whole situation in the world, and that is: that as America moves forward, we not only must think in terms of fighting Communism, but we must also think primarily in terms of the interests of these countries."
7805,-3,-1,We must associate ourselves with their aspirations.
7806,-3,-1,"We must let them know that the great American ideals - of independence, of the right of people to be free, and of the right to progress - that these are ideals that belong not to ourselves alone, but they belong to everybody."
7808,-3,-1,"And we can't do it unless we do have adequate funds for, for example, information which has been cut by the Congress, adequate funds for technical assistance."
7809,-3,-1,The other point that I would make with regard to economic assistance and technical assistance is that the United States must not rest its case here alone.
7810,-3,-1,This is primarily an ideological battle - a battle for the minds and the hearts and the souls of men.
7811,-3,-1,We must not meet the Communists purely in the field of gross atheistic materialism.
7812,-3,-1,We must stand for our ideals.
7817,-3,-1,To combat unemployment we first must concentrate on the very areas to which you refer - the so-called depressed areas.
7819,-3,1,Now the bill that the President had submitted would have provided more aid for those areas that really need it - areas like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the areas of West Virginia - than the ones that Senator Kennedy was supporting.
7821,-3,-1,"So point one, at the highest priority we must get a bill for depressed areas through the next Congress."
7823,-3,-1,"Second, as we consider this problem of unemployment, we have to realize where it is."
7824,-3,1,"In analyzing the figures we will find that our unemployment exists among the older citizens; it exists also among those who are inadequately trained; that is, those who do not have an adequate opportunity for education."
7826,-3,-1,"If we're going to combat unemployment, then, we have to do a better job in these areas."
7829,-3,-1,I believe this economy is sound and that we're going to move up.
7830,-3,-1,"But second, in addition to that, if we do get into a recessionary period we should move on that part of the economy which is represented by the private sector, and I mean stimulate that part of the economy that can create jobs - the private sector of the economy."
7831,-3,-1,This means through tax reform and if necessary tax cuts that will stimulate more jobs.
7832,-3,-1,I favor that rather than massive federal spending programs which will come into effect usually long after you've passed through the recessionary period.
7833,-3,-1,So we must use all of these weapons for the purpose of combating recession if it should come.
7837,-3,-1,I'm very familiar with it.
7840,-3,1,"We passed an area redevelopment bill far more effective than the bill the Administration suggested, on two occasions, and the President vetoed it both times."
7841,-3,1,We passed a bill again this year in the cong- in the Senate and it died in the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives.
7846,-3,1,I cannot still understand why this Administration and Mr. Nixon oppose putting medical care for the aged under Social Security to give them some security.
7848,-3,1,Five cents a day - that's what the food package averages per person.
7849,-3,-1,"Fourthly, I believe we should not carry out a hard money, high interest rate policy which helped intensify certainly the recession of 1958, and I think helped bring the slow-down of 1960."
7850,-3,-1,"If we move into a recession in sixty-one, then I would agree that we have to put more money into the economy, and it can be done by either one of the two methods discussed."
7851,-3,-1,One is by ex- the programs such as aid to education.
7852,-3,-1,The other would be to make a judgment on what's the most effective tax program to stimulate our economy.
7858,-3,-1,The question is what we're going to do in the future.
7860,-3,0,In fact uh - Mr. Nixon uh - discussed that a week ago in a speech.
7861,-3,-1,I believe that our power and prestige in the last eight years has declined.
7862,-3,-1,Now what is the issue is what we're going to do in the future.
7864,-3,-1,"He feels that we're moving ahead uh - in a - we're not going into a recession in this country, economically; he feels that our power and prestige is stronger than it ever was relative to that of the Communists, that we're moving ahead."
7870,-3,-1,That's the argument between Mr. Nixon and myself and on that issue the American people have to make their judgment and I think it's a important judgment.
7872,-3,-1,"Because we disagree very fundamentally on the position of the United States, and if his view prevails then I think that's going to bring an important result to this country in the sixties."
7875,-3,1,We gave more scholarships to the Congo - this summer we offered them - than we've given to all of Africa the year before.
7876,-3,1,Less than two hundred for all the countries of Africa and they need trained leadership more than anything.
7881,-3,-1,I think the choice is clear and it involves the future.
7883,-3,-1,"Well first of all, I think Senator Kennedy should make up his mind with regard to my responsibility."
7884,-3,0,In our first debate he indicated that I had not had experience or at least uh - had not participated significantly in the making of the decisions.
7885,-3,-1,I'm glad to hear tonight that he does suggest that I have had some experience.
7886,-3,-1,Let me make my position cl ear.
7888,-3,-1,I'm proud of the record of this Administration.
7889,-3,-1,I don't stand on it because it isn't something to stand on but something to build on.
7891,-3,-1,But what does he offer?
7893,-3,1,"I submit to you that as you look at his programs, his program for example with regard to the Federal Reserve and uh - free money or loose money uh - high - low interest rates, his program in the economic field generally are the programs that were adopted and tried during the Truman Administration."
7895,-3,-1,I say the programs and the leadership that failed then is not the program and the leadership that America needs now.
7896,-3,-1,I say that the American people don't want to go back to those policies.
7897,-3,-1,"And incidentally if Senator Kennedy disagrees, he should indicate where he believes those policies are different from those he's advocating today."
7902,-3,-1,It would not be appropriate for me to do so.
7903,-3,0,"The President is still going to be president for the next four months and he, of course, is the only one who could commit this country in this period."
7904,-3,-1,"As far as a summit conference is concerned, I want to make my position absolutely clear."
7905,-3,-1,I would be willing as president to meet with Mr. Khrushchev or any other world leader if it would serve the cause of peace.
7906,-3,-1,"I would not be able wou- would be willing to meet with him however, unless there were preparations for that conference which would give us some reasonable certainty - some reasonable certainty - that you were going to have some success."
7907,-3,-1,We must not build up the hopes of the world and then dash them as was the case in Paris.
7910,-3,-1,"Now, if we're going to have another summit conference, there must be negotiations at the diplomatic level - the ambassadors, the Secretaries of State, and others at that level - prior to that time, which will delineate the issues and which will prepare the way for the heads of state to meet and make some progress."
7911,-3,-1,"Otherwise, if we find the heads of state meeting and not making progress, we will find that the cause of peace will have been hurt rather than helped."
7912,-3,-1,"So under these circumstances, I, therefore, strongly urge and I will strongly hold, if I have the opportunity to urge or to hold - this position: that any summit conference would be gone into only after the most careful preparation and only after Mr. Khrushchev - after his disgraceful conduct at Paris, after his disgraceful conduct at the United Nations - gave some assurance that he really wanted to sit down and talk and to accomplish something and not just to make propaganda."
7914,-3,-1,I have no disagreement with the Vice President's position on that.
7916,-3,-1,Let me say there is only one uh - point I would add.
7917,-3,-1,"That before we go into the summit, before we ever meet again, I think it's important that the United States build its strength; that it build its military strength as well as its own economic strength."
7918,-3,-1,"If we negotiate from a position where the power balance or wave is moving away from us, it's extremely difficult to reach a successful decision on Berlin as well as the other questions."
7920,-3,-1,It's going to be a test of our nerve and will.
7921,-3,-1,It's going to be a test of our strength.
7922,-3,-1,"And because we're going to move in sixty-one and two, partly because we have not maintained our strength with sufficient vigor in the last years, I believe that before we meet that crisis, that the next president of the United States should send a message to Congress asking for a revitalization of our military strength, because come spring or late in the winter we're going to be face to face with the most serious Berlin crisis since l949 or fifty."
7924,-3,-1,"I would not meet Mr. Khrushchev unless there were some agreements at the secondary level - foreign ministers or ambassadors - which would indicate that the meeting would have some hope of success, or a useful exchange of ideas."
7931,-3,-1,"Well I don't think that in the winter of sixty-one under present economic conditions, it uh - a - uh - tax uh - increase would be desirable."
7932,-3,-1,"In fact, it would be deflationary; it would cause great unemployment; it would cause a real slowdown in our economy."
7934,-3,-1,I have talked in every speech about the fact that these are going to be very difficult times in the nineteen-sixties and that we're going to have to meet our responsibilities as citizens.
7935,-3,-1,I'm talking about a national mood.
7936,-3,-1,I'm talking about our willingness to bear any burdens in order to maintain our own freedom and in order to meet our freedom around the globe.
7937,-3,-1,We don't know what the future's going to bring.
7941,-3,-1,"If we're moving ahead, if we're providing a viable economy, if our people have sufficient resources so that they can consume what we produce; then this country's on the move, then we're stronger, then we set a better example to the world."
7942,-3,-1,"So we have the problem of not only building our own uh - military strength and extending uh - our policies abroad, we have to do a job here at home."
7943,-3,-1,So I believe that the policies that I recommend came under the general heading of strengthening the United States.
7947,-3,-1,"And I merely say that they - if they elect me president, I will do my best to carry the United States through a difficult period; but I would not want people to elect me because I promised them the easy, soft life."
7948,-3,-1,I think it's going to be difficult; but I'm confident that this country can meet its responsibilities.
7950,-3,-1,Well I think we should be no - under no illusions whatever about what the responsibilities of the American people will be in the sixties.
7951,-3,-1,"Our expenditures for defense, our expenditures for mutual security, our expenditures for economic assistance and technical assistance are not going to get less."
7952,-3,-1,In my opinion they're going to be de- be greater.
7953,-3,-1,I think it may be necessary that we have more taxes.
7956,-3,-1,But I would have no hesitation to ask the American people to pay the taxes even in l961 - if necessary - to maintain a sound economy and also to maintain a sound dollar.
7960,-3,-1,But it isn't going to be working that way.
7961,-3,-1,You can't add billions of dollars to our expenditures and not pay for it.
7968,-3,1,What I criticized were the policies that made it necessary to go to Korea.
7971,-3,-1,And I'd like to know where have we been defeated and where have we retreated?
7972,-3,1,"In the Truman Administration, six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain including the satellite countries of Eastern Europe and Communist China."
7973,-3,1,In this Administration we've stopped them at Quemoy and Matsu; we've stopped them in Indochina; we've stopped them in Lebanon; we've stopped them in other parts of the world.
7974,-3,-1,"I would also like to point out that as far as Senator Kennedy's comments are concerned, I think he has a perfect right and a responsibility to criticize this Administration whenever he thinks we're wrong."
7976,-3,-1,I don't think he should say that our prestige is at an all-time low.
7980,-3,-1,"Now, there are people who go to bed hungry in the United States - far less, incidentally, than used to go to bed hungry when we came into power at the end of the Truman Administration."
7982,-3,-1,"We're the best fed; we're the best clothed, with a better distribution of this world's goods to all of our people than any people in history."
7983,-3,-1,"Now, in pointing out the things that are wrong, I think we ought to emphasize America's strengths."
7984,-3,-1,It isn't necessary to - to run America down in order to build her up.
7985,-3,-1,Now so that we get it absolutely clear: Senator Kennedy must as a candidate - as I as a candidate in fifty-two - criticize us when we're wrong.
7986,-3,-1,"And he's doing a very effective job of that, in his way."
7987,-3,-1,"But on the other hand, he has a responsibility to be accurate."
7988,-3,-1,And I have a responsibility to correct him every time he misstates the case; and I intend to continue to do so.
7990,-3,1,"Well, Mr. Nixon uh- I'll just give you the testimony of Mr. George Aiken - Senator George Aiken, the ranking minority member - Republican member - and former chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee testifying in 1959 - said there were twenty-six million Americans who did not have the income to afford a decent diet."
7993,-3,-1,Now I've seen a good many hundreds of thousands of people who are uh - not adequately fed.
7995,-3,1,You can't tell me that any one who uses beans instead of meat in the United States - and there are twenty-five million of them according to Mr. Benson - is well fed or adequately fed.
7997,-3,-1,And they're not getting in many cases adequate shelter.
7998,-3,-1,And we ought to try to meet the problem.
7999,-3,0,"Secondly, Mr. Nixon has continued to state - and he stated it last week - these fantastic figures of what the Democratic budget would c- uh - platform would cost."
8007,-3,1,"Well, the United States uh - has on occasion attempted uh - mostly in the middle fifties, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to pull his troops back to Formosa."
8008,-3,-1,I believe strongly in the defense of Formosa.
8009,-3,0,"These islands are a few miles - five or six miles - off the coast of Red China, within a general harbor area and more than a hundred miles from Formosa."
8011,-3,-1,We say we will defend it if it's part of a general attack on Formosa.
8013,-3,1,"Now, Mr. Herter in 1958, when he was Under Secretary of State, said they were strategically undefensible."
8017,-3,-1,"One of the problems, I think, at the time of South Korea was the question of whether the United States would defend it if it were attacked."
8019,-3,-1,We should come to its defense.
8020,-3,-1,"To leave this rather in the air, that we will defend it under some conditions but not under other, I think is a mistake."
8021,-3,-1,"Secondly, I would not suggest the withdrawal at the point of the Communist gun."
8022,-3,-1,It is a decision finally that the Nationalists should make and I believe that we should consult with them and attempt to work out a plan by which the line is drawn at the island of Formosa.
8023,-3,0,It leaves a hundred miles between the sea.
8025,-3,-1,I think that uh - we should protect our commitments.
8026,-3,-1,I believe strongly we should do so in Berlin.
8027,-3,-1,I believe strongly we should d- do so in Formosa and I believe we should meet our commitments to every country whose security we've guaranteed.
8028,-3,-1,But I do not believe that that line in case of war should be drawn on those islands but instead on the island of Formosa.
8031,-3,-1,I disagree completely with Senator Kennedy on this point.
8032,-3,-1,"I remember in the period immediately before the Korean War, South Korea was supposed to be indefensible as well."
8034,-3,1,"And Secretary Acheson made a very famous speech at the Press Club, early in the year that k- Korean War started, indicating in effect that South Korea was beyond the defense zone of the United States."
8035,-3,-1,I suppose it was hoped when he made that speech that we wouldn't get into a war.
8038,-3,-1,"Now I think as far as Quemoy and Matsu are concerned, that the question is not these two little pieces of real estate - they are unimportant."
8039,-3,-1,It isn't the few people who live on them - they are not too important.
8043,-3,-1,We should not uh - force our Nationalist allies to get off of them and give them to the Communists.
8045,-3,-1,In my opinion this is the same kind of woolly thinking that led to disaster for America in Korea.
8047,-3,-1,"I would never tolerate it as president of the United States, and I will hope that Senator Kennedy will change his mind if he should be elected."
8055,-3,0,"I'm a student of history as is Senator Kennedy, incidentally; and I have found that in the history of this country we've had many great presidents."
8056,-3,0,Some of them have been Democrats and some of them have been Republicans.
8057,-3,-1,"The people, some way, have always understood that at a particular time a certain man was the one the country needed."
8058,-3,0,"Now, I believe that in an election when we are trying to determine who should lead the free world - not just America - perhaps, as Senator Kennedy has already indicated, the most important election in our history - it isn't the label that he wears or that I wear that counts."
8061,-3,-1,It's what we stand for.
8064,-3,-1,"I don't think it's enough for Senator Kennedy to go before the audiences on the Democratic side and say, ""Vote for me because I'm a Democrat."""
8066,-3,-1,What's involved here is the question of leadership for the whole free world.
8067,-3,-1,Now that means the best leadership.
8068,-3,-1,"It may be Republican, it may be Democratic."
8071,-3,-1,"And I believe the people, therefore, should be asked to make up their minds not simply on the basis of, ""Vote the way your grandfather did; vote the way your mother did."""
8072,-3,-1,"I think the people should put America first, rather than party first."
8074,-3,-1,"All that I can say is this: we do have programs in all of these fields - education, housing, defense - that will move America forward."
8075,-3,-1,"They will move her forward faster, and they will move her more surely than in his program."
8077,-3,-1,I'm sure he believes just as deeply that his will move that way.
8078,-3,-1,"I suggest, however, that in the interest of fairness that he could give me the benefit of also believing as he believes."
8080,-3,-1,"Well, let me say I do think that parties are important in that they tell something about the program and something about the man."
8082,-3,-1,The Democratic party in this century has stood for something.
8083,-3,-1,It has stood for progress; it has stood for concern for the people's welfare.
8085,-3,0,"The Republican party has produced McKinley and Harding, Coolidge, Dewey, and Landon."
8087,-3,-1,They stand for a whole different approach to the problems facing this country at home and abroad.
8088,-3,-1,That's the importance of party; only if it tells something about the record.
8089,-3,1,"And the Republicans in recent years - not only in the last twenty-five years, but in the last eight years - have opposed housing, opposed care for the aged, opposed federal aid to education, opposed minimum wage and I think that record tells something."
8110,-3,-1,"In the election of 1960, and with the world around us, the question is whether the world will exist half-slave or half-free, whether it will move in the direction of freedom, in the direction of the road that we are taking, or whether it will move in the direction of slavery."
8111,-3,-1,"I think it will depend in great measure upon what we do here in the United States, on the kind of society that we build, on the kind of strength that we maintain."
8112,-3,-1,"We discuss tonight domestic issues, but I would not want that to be any implication to be given that this does not involve directly our struggle with Mr. Khrushchev for survival."
8113,-3,0,"Mr. Khrushchev is in New York, and he maintains the Communist offensive throughout the world because of the productive power of the Soviet Union itself."
8114,-3,0,The Chinese Communists have always had a large population.
8115,-3,-1,But they are important and dangerous now because they are mounting a major effort within their own country.
8116,-3,-1,"The kind of country we have here, the kind of society we have, the kind of strength we build in the United States will be the defense of freedom."
8117,-3,-1,"If we do well here, if we meet our obligations, if we're moving ahead, then I think freedom will be secure around the world."
8118,-3,-1,"If we fail, then freedom fails."
8119,-3,-1,"Therefore, I think the question before the American people is: Are we doing as much as we can do?"
8120,-3,-1,Are we as strong as we should be?
8121,-3,-1,"Are we as strong as we must be if we're going to maintain our independence, and if we're going to maintain and hold out the hand of friendship to those who look to us for assistance, to those who look to us for survival?"
8122,-3,-1,"I should make it very clear that I do not think we're doing enough, that I am not satisfied as an American with the progress that we're making."
8125,-3,1,I'm not satisfied when the United States had last year the lowest rate of economic growth of any major industrialized society in the world.
8126,-3,-1,Because economic growth means strength and vitality; it means we're able to sustain our defenses; it means we're able to meet our commitments abroad.
8127,-3,1,"I'm not satisfied when we have over nine billion dollars worth of food - some of it rotting - even though there is a hungry world, and even though four million Americans wait every month for a food package from the government, which averages five cents a day per individual."
8129,-3,1,I'm not satisfied when the Soviet Union is turning out twice as many scientists and engineers as we are.
8130,-3,-1,"I'm not satisfied when many of our teachers are inadequately paid, or when our children go to school part-time shifts."
8131,-3,-1,I think we should have an educational system second to none.
8138,-3,1,He has one-third as much chance to get through college as a white student.
8140,-3,1,He has about uh - four times as much chance that he'll be out of work in his life as the white baby.
8141,-3,-1,I think we can do better.
8143,-3,-1,I know that there are those who want to turn everything over to the government.
8145,-3,-1,I want the individuals to meet their responsibilities.
8146,-3,-1,And I want the states to meet their responsibilities.
8147,-3,-1,But I think there is also a national responsibility.
8148,-3,-1,The argument has been used against every piece of social legislation in the last twenty-five years.
8150,-3,-1,"A cotton farmer in Georgia or a peanut farmer or a dairy farmer in Wisconsin and Minnesota, he cannot protect himself against the forces of supply and demand in the market place; but working together in effective governmental programs he can do so."
8151,-3,1,"Seventeen million Americans, who live over sixty-five on an average Social Security check of about seventy-eight dollars a month, they're not able to sustain themselves individually, but they can sustain themselves through the social security system."
8153,-3,-1,And I think that's the only way that the United States is going to maintain its freedom.
8154,-3,-1,It's the only way that we're going to move ahead.
8155,-3,-1,I think we can do a better job.
8156,-3,-1,I think we're going to have to do a better job if we are going to meet the responsibilities which time and events have placed upon us.
8157,-3,-1,We cannot turn the job over to anyone else.
8158,-3,-1,"If the United States fails, then the whole cause of freedom fails."
8159,-3,-1,And I think it depends in great measure on what we do here in this country.
8160,-3,-1,The reason Franklin Roosevelt was a good neighbor in Latin America was because he was a good neighbor in the United States.
8161,-3,-1,Because they felt that the American society was moving again.
8162,-3,-1,I want us to recapture that image.
8163,-3,-1,"I want people in Latin America and Africa and Asia to start to look to America; to see how we're doing things; to wonder what the resident of the United States is doing; and not to look at Khrushchev, or look at the Chinese Communists."
8166,-3,-1,I think our generation of Americans has the same rendezvous.
8167,-3,-1,The question now is: Can freedom be maintained under the most severe tack - attack it has ever known?
8169,-3,-1,And I think in the final analysis it depends upon what we do here.
8173,-3,-1,The things that Senator Kennedy has said many of us can agree with.
8174,-3,-1,There is no question but that we cannot discuss our internal affairs in the United States without recognizing that they have a tremendous bearing on our international position.
8177,-3,-1,"But when you're in a race, the only way to stay ahead is to move ahead."
8178,-3,-1,"And I subscribe completely to the spirit that Senator Kennedy has expressed tonight, the spirit that the United States should move ahead."
8179,-3,-1,"Where, then, do we disagree?"
8180,-3,-1,I think we disagree on the implication of his remarks tonight and on the statements that he has made on many occasions during his campaign to the effect that the United States has been standing still.
8181,-3,1,"We heard tonight, for example, the statement made that our growth in national product last year was the lowest of any industrial nation in the world."
8184,-3,-1,But when we look at the growth of G.N.P.
8185,-3,1,"this year, a year of recovery, we find that it's six and nine-tenths per cent and one of the highest in the world today."
8187,-3,-1,"Looking then to this problem of how the United States should move ahead and where the United States is moving, I think it is well that we take the advice of a very famous campaigner: Let's look at the record."
8189,-3,-1,"Is it true that this Administration, as Senator Kennedy has charged, has been an Administration of retreat, of defeat, of stagnation?"
8191,-3,-1,"Well, we have a comparison that we can make."
8192,-3,-1,We have the record of the Truman Administration of seven and a half years and the seven and a half years of the Eisenhower Administration.
8195,-3,1,"We have built more schools in these last seven and a half years than we built in the previous seven and a half, for that matter in the previous twenty years."
8197,-3,1,We have developed more hydroelectric power in these seven and a half years than was developed in any previous administration in history.
8199,-3,1,We find that more have been built in this Administration than in the previous Administration.
8200,-3,1,The same is true of highways.
8201,-3,-1,Let's put it in terms that all of us can understand.
8202,-3,1,We often hear gross national product discussed and in that respect may I say that when we compare the growth in this Administration with that of the previous Administration that then there was a total growth of eleven percent over seven years; in this Administration there has been a total growth of nineteen per cent over seven years.
8204,-3,-1,But let's not put it there; let's put it in terms of the average family.
8205,-3,-1,What has happened to you?
8206,-3,1,We find that your wages have gone up five times as much in the Eisenhower Administration as they did in the Truman Administration.
8208,-3,1,We find that the prices you pay went up five times as much in the Truman Administration as they did in the Eisenhower Administration.
8209,-3,-1,What's the net result of this?
8210,-3,1,This means that the average family income went up fifteen per cent in the Eisenhower years as against two per cent in the Truman years.
8211,-3,-1,"Now, this is not standing still."
8212,-3,-1,"But, good as this record is, may I emphasize it isn't enough."
8213,-3,-1,A record is never something to stand on.
8215,-3,-1,"And in building on this record, I believe that we have the secret for progress, we know the way to progress."
8216,-3,-1,"And I think, first of all, our own record proves that we know the way."
8218,-3,-1,I respect the sincerity which he m- which he makes that suggestion.
8221,-3,-1,"And I would suggest that during the course of the evening he might indicate those areas in which his programs are new, where they will mean more progress than we had then."
8223,-3,-1,"We are for programs that will expand educational opportunities, that will give to all Americans their equal chance for education, for all of the things which are necessary and dear to the hearts of our people."
8224,-3,-1,"We are for programs, in addition, which will see that our medical care for the aged are - is - are much - is much better handled than it is at the present time."
8225,-3,-1,"Here again, may I indicate that Senator Kennedy and I are not in disagreement as to the aims."
8226,-3,-1,We both want to help the old people.
8227,-3,-1,We want to see that they do have adequate medical care.
8230,-3,-1,"I could give better examples, but for - for whatever it is, whether it's in the field of housing, or health, or medical care, or schools, or the eh- development of electric power, we have programs which we believe will move America, move her forward and build on the wonderful record that we have made over these past seven and a half years."
8231,-3,-1,"Now, when we look at these programs, might I suggest that in evaluating them we often have a tendency to say that the test of a program is how much you're spending."
8232,-3,-1,I will concede that in all the areas to which I have referred Senator Kennedy would have the spe- federal government spend more than I would have it spend.
8233,-3,-1,I costed out the cost of the Democratic platform.
8234,-3,1,It runs a minimum of thirteen and two-tenths billions dollars a year more than we are presently spending to a maximum of eighteen billion dollars a year more than we're presently spending.
8236,-3,1,"It will cost a minimum of four billion dollars a year more, a maximum of four and nine-tenths billion dollar a year more than we're presently spending."
8237,-3,-1,"Now, does this mean that his program is better than ours?"
8240,-3,-1,It is a question of which administration does the right thing.
8241,-3,-1,"And in our case, I do believe that our programs will stimulate the creative energies of a hundred and eighty million free Americans."
8242,-3,-1,"I believe the programs that Senator Kennedy advocates will have a tendency to stifle those creative energies, I believe in other words, that his program would lead to the stagnation of the motive power that we need in this country to get progress."
8244,-3,-1,Let us understand throughout this campaign that his motives and mine are sincere.
8245,-3,-1,I know what it means to be poor.
8246,-3,-1,I know what it means to see people who are unemployed.
8247,-3,-1,"I know Senator Kennedy feels as deeply about these problems as I do, but our disagreement is not about the goals for America but only about the means to reach those goals."
8257,-3,-1,"Secondly, I think the question is uh - what are the programs that we advocate, what is the party record that we lead?"
8259,-3,0,Mr. Nixon comes out of the Republican party.
8260,-3,0,He was nominated by it.
8261,-3,1,"And it is a fact that through most of these last twenty-five years the Republican leadership has opposed federal aid for education, medical care for the aged, development of the Tennessee Valley, development of our natural resources."
8262,-3,-1,I think Mr. Nixon is an effective leader of his party.
8263,-3,-1,I hope he would grant me the same.
8264,-3,-1,The question before us is: which point of view and which party do we want to lead the United States?
8270,-3,-1,It would be rather difficult to cover them in eight and- in two and a half minutes.
8271,-3,-1,I would suggest that these proposals could be mentioned.
8273,-3,0,"For example, after my first trip abroad - abroad, I strongly recommended that we increase our exchange programs particularly as they related to exchange of persons of leaders in the labor field and in the information field."
8275,-3,1,"Uh - I have made other recommendations after each of the other trips; for example, after my trip abroad to Hungary I made some recommendations with regard to the Hungarian refugee situation which were adopted, not only by the President but some of them were enacted into law by the Congress."
8279,-3,-1,"Well, I would say in the latter that the - and that's what I found uh - somewhat unsatisfactory about the figures uh - Mr. Nixon, that you used in your previous speech, when you talked about the Truman Administration."
8280,-3,0,"You - Mr. Truman came to office in nineteen uh - forty-four and at the end of the war, and uh - difficulties that were facing the United States during that period of transition - 1946 when price controls were lifted - so it's rather difficult to use an overall figure taking those seven and a half years and comparing them to the last eight years."
8285,-3,1,"We did come forward with a program of students for the Congo of over three hundred which was more than the federal government had for all of Africa the previous year, so that I don't think that uh - we have moved at least in those two areas with sufficient vigor."
8294,-3,-1,"Well, because I think that if the federal government moved out of the program and withdrew its supports uh - then I think you would have complete uh - economic chaos."
8295,-3,0,The farmer plants in the spring and harvests in the fall.
8297,-3,-1,They really don't - they're not able to control their market very well.
8299,-3,-1,They have only a few purchasers that buy their milk or their hogs - a few large companies in many cases - and therefore the farmer is not in a position to bargain very effectively in the market place.
8301,-3,-1,"And if the agricultural economy collapses, then the economy of the rest of the United States sooner or later will collapse."
8305,-3,-1,So I think the case for the government intervention is a good one.
8307,-3,1,"The dropping of the support price in order to limit production does not work, and we now have the highest uh - surpluses - nine billion dollars worth."
8309,-3,-1,I think that this farm policy has failed.
8313,-3,-1,I think Mr. Benson's program has failed.
8314,-3,-1,"And I must say, after reading the Vice President's speech before the farmers, as he read mine, I don't believe that it's very much different from Mr. Benson's."
8315,-3,-1,I don't think it provides effective governmental controls.
8317,-3,-1,I therefore do not believe that this is a sharp enough breach with the past to give us any hope of success for the future.
8322,-3,-1,I don't think this has worked in the past; I do not think it will work in the future.
8325,-3,-1,And that's the fundamental reason why we can't let the farmer go by himself at the present time.
8327,-3,-1,"Now that we have these surpluses, it's our responsibility to indemnify the farmer during that period that we get rid of the farmer uh - the surpluses."
8328,-3,-1,"Until we get the surpluses off the farmer's back, however, we should have a program such as I announced, which will see that farm income holds up."
8329,-3,-1,"But I would propose holding that income up not through a type of program that Senator Kennedy has suggested that would raise prices, but one that would indemnify the farmer, pay the farmer in kind uh - from the products which are in surplus."
8337,-3,-1,"Well, I would suggest, Mr. Vanocur, that uh - if you know the President, that was probably a facetious remark."
8338,-3,-1,"Uh - I would also suggest that insofar as his statement is concerned, that I think it would be improper for the President of the United States to disclose uh - the instances in which members of his official family had made recommendations, as I have made them through the years to him, which he has accepted or rejected."
8340,-3,-1,"Now, I can only say this."
8341,-3,0,Through the years I have sat in the National Security Council.
8350,-3,-1,"And I would say that no president should ever allow anybody else to make the major decisions, The president only makes the decisions."
8352,-3,-1,"As far as what experience counts and whether that is experience that counts, that isn't for me to say."
8354,-3,0,"As he pointed out, we came to the Congress in the same year."
8356,-3,0,Mine has been in the executive branch.
8358,-3,-1,I would say that the people now have the opportunity to evaluate his as against mine and I think both he and I are going to abide by whatever the people decide.
8360,-3,-1,"Well, I'll just say that the question is of experience and the question also is uh - what our judgment is of the future, and what our goals are for the United States, and what ability we have to implement those goals."
8362,-3,-1,There's no certain road to the presidency.
8374,-3,-1,"I think you have heavy obligations which affect our security, which we're going to have to meet."
8375,-3,1,"And therefore I've never suggested we should uh - be able to retire the debt substantially, or even at all in nineteen sixty-one or two."
8381,-3,-1,Not reducing the interest -
8383,-3,-1,- reducing the interest rate.
8384,-3,-1,"In my judgment, the hard money, tight money policy, fiscal policy of this Administration has contributed to the slow-down in our economy, which helped bring the recession of fifty-four; which made the recession of fifty-eight rather intense, and which has slowed, somewhat, our economic activity in 1960."
8385,-3,-1,"What I have talked about, however, the kind of programs that I've talked about, in my judgment, are uh - fiscally sound."
8386,-3,-1,"Medical care for the aged, I would put under social security."
8388,-3,1,"The program - the Javits-Nixon or the Nixon-Javits program - would have cost, if fully used uh - six hundred million dollars by the government per year, and six hundred million dollars by the state."
8389,-3,1,"The program which I advocated, which failed by five votes in the United States Senate, would have put medical care for the aged in Social Security, and would have been paid for through the Social Security System and the Social Security tax."
8390,-3,-1,"Secondly, I support federal aid to education and federal aid for teachers' salaries."
8391,-3,-1,I think that's a good investment.
8392,-3,-1,I think we're going to have to do it.
8393,-3,-1,"And I think to heap the burden further on the property tax, which is already strained in many of our communities, will provide, will make sh- insure, in my opinion, that many of our children will not be adequately educated, and many of our teachers not adequately compensated."
8395,-3,-1,"On the question of the development of natural resources, I would pay as you go in the sense that they would be balanced and the power revenues would bring back sufficient money to finance the projects, in the same way as the Tennessee Valley."
8397,-3,-1,And the only conditions under which I would unbalance the budget would be if there was a grave national emergency or a serious recession.
8399,-3,-1,"Whatever is brought in, I think that we can finance essential programs within a balanced budget, if business remains orderly."
8404,-3,-1,As a matter of fact it will be necessary to raise taxes.
8406,-3,-1,"That, however, is raising taxes for those who pay Social Security."
8409,-3,-1,"And so I would say that in all of these proposals Senator Kennedy has made, they will result in one of two things: either he has to raise taxes or he has to unbalance the budget."
8410,-3,-1,"If he unbalances the budget, that means you have inflation, and that will be, of course, a very cruel blow to the very people - the older people - that we've been talking about."
8419,-3,-1,I'm awfully glad you ge- got that question because as you know I got into it at the last of my other question and wasn't able to complete the argument.
8420,-3,1,"Uh - I think that the reason that I voted against having the federal government uh - pay teachers' salaries was probably the very reason that concerned Senator Kennedy when in January of this year, in his kick-off press conference, he said that he favored aid for school construction, but at that time did not feel that there should be aid for teachers' salaries - at least that's the way I read his remarks."
8421,-3,-1,"Now, why should there be any question about the federal government aiding s- teachers' salaries?"
8423,-3,-1,Why do I take it now?
8425,-3,-1,We need higher teachers' salaries.
8426,-3,-1,But we also want our education to be free of federal control.
8427,-3,-1,"When the federal government gets the power to pay teachers, inevitably in my opinion, it will acquire the power to set standards and to tell the teachers what to teach."
8428,-3,-1,I think this would be bad for the country; I think it would be bad for the teaching profession.
8429,-3,-1,There is another point that should be made.
8430,-3,-1,I favor higher salaries for teachers.
8433,-3,-1,"I believe, in other words, that we have seen the local communities and the state assuming more of that responsibility."
8434,-3,1,Teachers' salaries very fortunately have gone up fifty percent in the last eight years as against only a thirty-four percent rise for other salaries.
8435,-3,-1,This is not enough; it should be more.
8436,-3,-1,But I do not believe that the way to get more salaries for teachers is to have the federal government get in with a massive program.
8441,-3,-1,The issue before the Senate was that the money would be given to the state.
8444,-3,1,"I voted in favor of that proposal and supported it strongly, because I think that that provided assistance to our teachers for their salaries without any chance of federal control and it is on that vote that th- Mr. Nixon and I disagreed, and his tie vote uh - defeated his breaking the tie defeated the proposal."
8445,-3,-1,I don't want the federal government paying teachers' salaries directly.
8446,-3,-1,"But if the money will go to the states and the states can then determine whether it shall go for school construction or for teachers' salaries, in my opinion you protect the local authority over the school board and the school committee."
8449,-3,1,"That is wholly wrong, wholly in error, and it is a fact that in the last eight years the Democratic Congress has reduced the appropri- the requests for the appropriations by over ten billion dollars."
8451,-3,-1,My view is that you can do these programs - and they should be carefully drawn - within a balanced budget if our economy is moving ahead.
8456,-3,-1,Well as you take the bills -
8459,-3,1,It failed because the House did not pass it and the House failed by eleven votes.
8463,-3,1,"Secondly, we passed a federal aid to education bill in the Senate."
8464,-3,1,It failed to came to the floor of the House of Representatives.
8465,-3,1,It was killed in the Rules Committee.
8466,-3,1,And it is a fact in the August session that the four members of the Rules Committee who were Republicans joining with two Democrats voted against sending the aid to education bill to the floor of the House.
8472,-3,1,"Forty-four Democrats voted for it, one Republican voted for it."
8473,-3,1,And we were informed at the time it came to a vote that if it was adopted the President of the United States would veto it.
8474,-3,-1,"In my judgment, a vigorous Democratic president supported by a Democratic majority in the House and Senate can win the support for these programs."
8478,-3,-1,"First of all, I don't see how it's possible for a one-third of a body, such as the Republicans have in the House and the Senate to stop two-thirds, if the two-thirds are adequately led."
8479,-3,1,"I would say, too, that when Senator Kennedy refers to the action of the House Rules Committee, there are eight Democrats on that committee and four Republicans."
8480,-3,-1,It would seem to me again that it is very difficult to blame the four Republicans for the eight Democrats' not getting a something through that particular committee.
8482,-3,-1,"When the president exercises his veto power, he has to have the people upo- behind him, not just a third of the Congress."
8484,-3,-1,If the majority of the members of the Congress felt that these particular proposals were good issues - the majority of those who were Democrats - why didn't they pass them and send to the President and get a veto and have an issue?
8485,-3,-1,The reason why these particular bills in these various fields that have been mentioned were not passed was not because the President was against them; it was because the people were against them.
8486,-3,-1,It was because they were too extreme.
8487,-3,-1,"And I am convinced that the alternate proposals that I have, that the Republicans have in the field of health, in the field of education, in the field of welfare, because they are not extreme, because they will accomplish the end uh - without too great cost in dollars or in freedom, that they could get through the next Congress."
8490,-3,-1,"I would say this; that we, of course, expect to pick up some seats in both in the House and the Senate."
8491,-3,-1,"Uh - We would hope to control the House, to get a majority in the House uh - in this election."
8492,-3,-1,"We cannot, of course, control the Senate."
8493,-3,-1,"I would say that a president will be able to lead - a president will be able to get his program through - to the effect that he has the support of the country, the support of the people."
8494,-3,-1,Sometimes we - we get the opinion that in getting programs through the House or the Senate it's purely a question of legislative finagling and all that sort of thing.
8498,-3,-1,"Now, I also say that as far as Senator Kennedy's proposals are concerned, that, again, the question is not simply one of uh - a presidential veto stopping programs."
8499,-3,-1,You must always remember that a president can't stop anything unless he has the people behind him.
8506,-3,-1,"It - it was a very uh - because of the defeat of teacher salaries, it was not a bill that uh - met in my opinion the need."
8507,-3,1,"The fact of the matter is it was a bill that was less than you recommended, Mr. Nixon, this morning in your proposal."
8508,-3,1,"It was not an extreme bill and yet we could not get one Republican to join, at least I think four of the eight Democrats voted to send it to the floor of the House - not one Republican - and they joined with those Democrats who were opposed to it."
8509,-3,-1,I don't say the Democrats are united in their support of the program.
8514,-3,1,"The proposal advanced by you and by Mr. Javits would have cost six hundred millions of dollars - Mr. Rockefeller rejected it in New York, said he didn't agree with the financing at all, said it ought to be on Social Security."
8516,-3,-1,I think it shows the difference between the two parties.
8517,-3,-1,One party is ready to move in these programs.
8522,-3,-1,"Well, I think they're serious."
8523,-3,-1,I think it's a matter that we should continue to uh - give uh - great care and attention to.
8524,-3,-1,We should support uh - the laws which the United States has passed in order to protect us from uh - those who would destroy us from within.
8525,-3,-1,"We should sustain uh - the Department of Justice in its efforts and the F.B.I., and we should be continually alert."
8526,-3,-1,"I think if the United States is maintaining a strong society here in the United States, I think that we can meet any internal threat."
8527,-3,-1,The major threat is external and will continue.
8529,-3,-1,I agree with Senator Kennedy's appraisal generally in this respect.
8531,-3,-1,It is one that will continue to be a problem for years to come.
8534,-3,-1,It is also essential in being alert that we be fair; fair because by being fair we uphold the very freedoms that the Communists would destroy.
8537,-3,-1,"And in that connection I again would say that while Senator Kennedy says we are for the status quo, I do believe that he uh - would agree that I am just as sincere in believing that my proposals for federal aid to education, my proposals for health care are just as sincerely held as his."
8538,-3,-1,The question again is not one of goals - we're for those goals - it's one of means.
8544,-3,-1,As a matter of fact your question brings out a point that I am very glad to make.
8545,-3,-1,Too often in appraising whether we are moving ahead or not we think only of what the federal government is doing.
8548,-3,1,We have for example a gross national product of approximately five hundred billion dollars.
8549,-3,1,Roughly a hundred billion to a hundred and a quarter billion of that is the result of government activity.
8550,-3,1,"Four hundred billion, approximately, is a result of what individuals do."
8555,-3,1,"Well, I must say that the reason that the schools have been constructed is because the local school districts were willing to increase the property taxes to a tremendously high figure - in my opinion, almost to the point of diminishing returns in order to sustain these schools."
8556,-3,-1,"Secondly, I think we have a rich uh - country."
8557,-3,-1,And I think we have a powerful country.
8558,-3,-1,"I think what we have to do, however, is have the president and the leadership set before our country exactly what we must do in the next decade, if we're going to maintain our security in education, in economic growth, in development of natural resources."
8559,-3,-1,The Soviet Union is making great gains.
8560,-3,-1,"It isn't enough to compare what might have been done eight years ago, or ten years ago, or fifteen years ago, or twenty years ago."
8561,-3,-1,"I want to compare what we're doing with what our adversaries are doing, so that by the year 1970 the United States is ahead in education, in health, in building, in homes, in economic strength."
8572,-3,-1,But the reason for that is obvious.
8573,-3,-1,They start from a much lower base.
8574,-3,1,"Although they have been moving faster in growth than we have, we find, for example, today that their total gross national product is only forty-four per cent of our total gross national product."
8575,-3,1,That's the same percentage that it was twenty years ago.
8576,-3,1,"And as far as the absolute gap is concerned, we find that the United States is even further ahead than it was twenty years ago."
8577,-3,-1,Is this any reason for complacency?
8578,-3,-1,Not at all Because these are determined men.
8580,-3,-1,And we have to get the very most of uh - out uh - out of our economy.
8581,-3,-1,I agree with Senator Kennedy completely on that score.
8582,-3,-1,Where we disagree is in the means that we would use to get the most out of our economy.
8583,-3,-1,"I respectfully submit that Senator Kennedy too often would rely too much on the federal government, on what it would do to solve our problems, to stimulate growth."
8584,-3,-1,"I believe that when we examine the Democratic platform, when we examine the proposals that he has discussed tonight, when we compare them with the proposals that I have made, that these proposals that he makes would not result in greater growth for this country than would be the case if we followed the programs that I have advocated."
8586,-3,-1,The one in the field of health is worth mentioning.
8589,-3,-1,But it compels nobody to have insurance who does not want it.
8593,-3,1,The other point that I would make is this: this downgrading of how much things cost I think many of our people will understand better when they look at what happened when - during the Truman Administration when the government was spending more than it took in - we found savings over a lifetime eaten up by inflation.
8599,-3,1,The point was made by Mr. Nixon that the Soviet production is only forty-four percent of ours.
8600,-3,-1,I must say that forty-four percent and that Soviet country is causing us a good deal of trouble tonight.
8601,-3,-1,I want to make sure that it stays in that relationship.
8602,-3,-1,"I don't want to see the day when it's sixty percent of ours, and seventy and seventy-five and eighty and ninety percent of ours, with all the force and power that it could bring to bear in order to cause our destruction."
8606,-3,-1,I think it's a very clear contrast.
8607,-3,1,"In 1935, when the Social Security Act was written, ninety-four out of ninety-five Republicans voted against it."
8609,-3,1,"In August of 1960, when we tried to get it again, but this time for medical care, we received the support of one Republican in the Senate on this occasion."
8610,-3,-1,"Thirdly, I think the question before the American people is: as they look at this country and as they look at the world around them, the goals are the same for all Americans."
8611,-3,-1,The means are at question.
8614,-3,-1,I think you should vote for Mr. Nixon.
8616,-3,-1,"As I said at the beginning, the question before us all, that faces all Republicans and all Democrats, is: can freedom in the next generation conquer, or are the Communists going to be successful?"
8619,-3,-1,"If we fail, if we fail to move ahead, if we fail to develop sufficient military and economic and social strength here in this country, then I think that uh - the tide could begin to run against us."
8620,-3,-1,"And I don't want historians, ten years from now, to say, these were the years when the tide ran out for the United States."
8621,-3,-1,I want them to say these were the years when the tide came in; these were the years when the United States started to move again.
8622,-3,-1,"That's the question before the American people, and only you can decide what you want, what you want this country to be, what you want to do with the future."
8623,-3,-1,I think we're ready to move.
8624,-3,-1,"And it is to that great task, if we're successful, that we will address ourselves."
8661,-3,-1,"Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I."
8662,-3,0,The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend.
8663,-3,-1,But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me.
8665,-3,1,"I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year - and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion - that that simply would be irresponsible."
8667,-3,1,"Even though we've seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we've also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry."
8669,-3,-1,I think we've got to have fiscal restraint.
8670,-3,1,"And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees."
8674,-3,-1,"fiscal restraint, I think is necessary."
8679,-3,-1,"I believe that the only unpopular measures, actually, that could be, or would be applied, would be unpopular with the government, and with those."
8685,-3,-1,"And so, the plan that I have proposed - and contrary to what John says, my plan is for a phased-in tax cut over a three-year period, tax increase and depreciation allowances for business and industry to give them the capital to refurbish plant and equipment, research and development, improved technology - all of which we see our foreign competitors having, and we have the greatest percentage of outmoded industrial plant and equipment of any of the industrial nations - produce more, have stable money supply, and give the people of this country a greater share of their own savings."
8686,-3,0,"Now, I know that this has been called inflationary by my opponent and by the man who isn't here tonight."
8687,-3,-1,"But I don't see where it is inflationary to have people keep more of their earnings and spend it, and it isn't inflationary for government to take that money away from them and spend it on the things it wants to spend it on."
8688,-3,1,"I believe we need incentive for the individual, and for business and industry, and I believe the plan that I have submitted, with detailed backing, and which has been approved by a number of our leading economists in the country, is based on projections."
8689,-3,-1,"conservative projections out for the next five years, that indicates that this plan would, by 1983, result in a balanced budget."
8690,-3,1,"We have to remember, when we talk a tax cut, we're only talking about reducing a tax increase, because this Administration has left us with a built-in tax increase that will amount to $86 billion next year."
8694,-3,1,"Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline."
8695,-3,-1,"I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that."
8697,-3,1,"And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30."
8698,-3,1,"In other words, we've had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country - or much of it - into the pockets of OPEC oil producers."
8700,-3,-1,"put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil."
8701,-3,-1,"Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments."
8703,-3,-1,"That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country."
8705,-3,-1,"Well, I cannot see where a $.50 a gallon tax applied to gasoline would have changed the price of gasoline."
8709,-3,-1,Why take it in the first place if you're going to give it back?
8711,-3,-1,"And John spoke about 15 years ago, on the position that he."
8713,-3,1,"Fifteen months ago, he was a cosigner and advocating the very tax cut that I am proposing, and said that that would be a forward step in fighting inflation, and that it would be beneficial to the working people of this country."
8719,-3,-1,"Anything that would preserve, or help us use less energy, that would be fine, and I'm for it."
8720,-3,-1,"But I do not believe that conservation alone is the answer to the present energy problem, because all you're doing then is staving off, by a short time, the day when you would come to the end of the energy supply."
8722,-3,1,"The fact is, that in today's oil wells, there is more oil still there than we have so far taken out and used."
8723,-3,-1,But it would require what is known as secondary or tertiary efforts to bring it out of the ground.
8725,-3,1,"There are hundreds of millions of acres of land that have been taken out of circulation by the Government for whatever reason they have, that is believed by the most knowledgeable oil geologists to contain probably more oil and natural gas than we have used so far since we drilled that first well 121 years ago."
8726,-3,1,"We have a coal supply that is equal to 50% of the world's coal supply, good for centuries, in this country."
8727,-3,-1,"I grant you that prices may go up, because as you go further and have to go deeper, you are adding to the cost of production."
8728,-3,-1,"We have nuclear power, which, I believe, with the safest."
8739,-3,-1,"all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that's going to be enough."
8740,-3,-1,"I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people."
8743,-3,-1,"But at the same time, I think it's going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile."
8744,-3,-1,We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities.
8745,-3,-1,"We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling."
8746,-3,-1,"We're going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient."
8747,-3,1,"I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country."
8748,-3,-1,"Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve."
8749,-3,1,"According to one study that was published a short time ago - the Harvard Business School study - indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today."
8750,-3,-1,"So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy."
8752,-3,-1,"Well, as I've said, I am not an enemy of conservation."
8753,-3,-1,I wouldn't be called a conservative if I were.
8755,-3,1,"That is the same Government that, in 1920, told us we only had enough oil left for 13 years, and 19 years later, told us we only had enough left for another 15 years."
8756,-3,-1,"As for saving energy and conserving, the American people haven't been doing badly at that."
8757,-3,1,"Because in industry today, we're producing more, over the last several years, and at 12% less use of energy than we were back in about 1973."
8759,-3,-1,"So, I think we are proving that we can go forward with conservation and benefit from that."
8760,-3,1,"But also, I think it is safe to say that we do have sources of energy that have not yet been used or found."
8762,-3,-1,"Mr. Greenberg, I think my opponent in this debate tonight is overlooking one other very important fact."
8763,-3,-1,"And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem."
8768,-3,-1,"I think that conservation - I think that a change in lifestyles - is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later."
8777,-3,-1,"Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country."
8783,-3,1,"I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short."
8784,-3,1,"But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 - and I worked hard for it and supported it - we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living."
8786,-3,0,"And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today."
8791,-3,-1,"But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended."
8795,-3,-1,"Mr. Corddry, it's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement on this particular issue, and the only one who would be disagreeing with us is the President, if he were present."
8797,-3,1,"As a matter of fact, today the shortages of non-commissioned officers that John mentioned are such that if we tried to have a draft today, we wouldn't have the non-commissioned officers to train the draftees."
8798,-3,-1,"I believe the answer lies in just recognizing human nature and how we make everything else work in this country, when we want it to work."
8799,-3,-1,Recognize that we have a voluntary military.
8802,-3,-1,As an aid to enlistment.
8803,-3,1,"we had an aid - 46% of the people who enlisted in the voluntary military up until 1977 said they did so for one particular reason, the G.I."
8805,-3,1,"In 1977, we took that away from the military."
8806,-3,1,That meant immediately 46% of your people that were signing up had no reason for signing up.
8807,-3,-1,"So I think it is a case of pay scale, of recognizing that if we're going to have young men and women responsible for our security, dealing with this sophisticated equipment, then for heaven's sakes, let's go out and have a pay scale that is commensurate with the sacrifice that we're asking of them."
8808,-3,-1,"Along with this, I think we need something else that has been allowed to deteriorate."
8809,-3,-1,"We need a million-man active reserve that could be called up on an instant's notice, and that would be also trained, ready to use that type of equipment."
8810,-3,-1,"Both of these, I think, would respond to the proper kind of incentives that we could offer these people."
8821,-3,-1,"I must say that I think I have better opportunity, however, of finding the necessary funds to pay what, admittedly, will be very, very substantial sums of money."
8823,-3,1,"or we passed one bill, just a couple of weeks ago in the House of Representatives for $500 million - a half a billion dollars."
8826,-3,1,I've just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion.
8827,-3,1,"The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs - not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on - when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion."
8828,-3,-1,I would propose to save the taxpayers of this country from that kind of costly boondoggle.
8832,-3,-1,He's talking about that fantastic plan of the Administration to take thousands and thousands of square miles out in the Western states.
8834,-3,-1,"We need the missile, I think, because we are so out of balance strategically that we lack a deterrent to a possible first assault."
8843,-3,-1,I don't think I'd have to go against that pledge.
8844,-3,-1,I think one of the problems today with the cities is Federal aid.
8847,-3,-1,"for a specific cause or a specific objective, come with such red tape, such priorities established by a bureaucracy in Washington, that the local government's hands are tied with regard to using that money as they feel could best be used, and for what they think might be the top priority."
8849,-3,-1,"What I have been advocating is, why don't we start with the Federal Government turning back tax sources to states and local governments, as well as the responsibilities for those programs?"
8852,-3,-1,"But, where are we getting the money that the Federal Government is putting out to help them?"
8854,-3,1,"But Detroit is being taxed for money that, let's say, will go to Chicago, while Chicago is being taxed to help with the problems in Philadelphia."
8855,-3,-1,Wouldn't it make a lot more sense if the government let them keep their own money there in the first place?
8856,-3,-1,"But there are other things that we can do with the inner cities, and I've believed."
8858,-3,1,"The government isn't getting a tax now from businesses there because they aren't there, or from individuals who are on welfare rather than working."
8859,-3,-1,And why don't we offer incentives for business and industry to start up in those zones?
8860,-3,-1,Give them a tax moratorium for a period if they build and develop there.
8861,-3,-1,The individuals that would then get jobs - give them a break that encourages them to leave the social welfare programs and go to work.
8869,-3,1,"Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America - the large cities of this country - are in worse shape today than they were in 1960."
8871,-3,1,"Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits."
8872,-3,1,"I'm happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America."
8874,-3,1,"I was in North Pittsburgh - I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign - the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn't money available to fix them."
8875,-3,-1,"And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs."
8878,-3,-1,"That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities."
8879,-3,-1,"In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country."
8883,-3,-1,John claims that he is making plain where the money will come from.
8885,-3,-1,It will come from the pockets of the people who are living in those very areas.
8887,-3,-1,"if Pittsburgh does not have the money to fix the leaking water mains, it's because the Federal Government has pre-empted."
8888,-3,-1,"Now, the Federal Government is going to turn around and say, well you have this problem; we will now hand you the money to do it."
8893,-3,0,"I stood there, and I met the people."
8896,-3,-1,"But I believe that my plan might offer an opportunity for that, if we would move into those areas and let, encourage - with the tax incentive - the private sector, to develop and to create the jobs for the people."
8898,-3,-1,"Well, of course, where has the private sector been, Governor Reagan, during the years that our cities have been deteriorating?"
8899,-3,1,It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country.
8900,-3,1,"We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth."
8903,-3,-1,And why have they lost their industry?
8912,-3,-1,"Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it's going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver."
8914,-3,-1,"Well, we've seen what has happened."
8915,-3,1,We haven't gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven't gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter's first term.
8916,-3,1,"Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%."
8917,-3,1,"And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index - that's about 18% on an annualized basis - what it's going to be."
8919,-3,-1,I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan.
8920,-3,1,"His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information."
8922,-3,-1,I've been very careful - I have been very careful in saying that what I'm going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first.
8923,-3,-1,"I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done."
8926,-3,1,"And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more."
8927,-3,-1,"So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes."
8929,-3,-1,"I'm going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I've talked about."
8936,-3,0,"We have a back-up paper to my economic speech of a couple of weeks ago in Chicago, that gives all of the figures."
8937,-3,1,"And we used - yes, we used - the Senate Budget Committee's projections for five years, which are based on an average inflation rate of 7.5% - which, I think, that under our plan, can be eliminated."
8942,-3,-1,"Well, if you've got a kid that's extravagant, you can lecture him all you want to about his extravagance."
8943,-3,-1,Or you can cut his allowance and achieve the same end much quicker.
8944,-3,1,But Government has never reduced Government does not tax to get the money it needs.
8946,-3,1,"And when John talks about his non-inflationary plan, as far as I have been able to learn, there are 88 proposals in it that call for additional Government spending programs."
8947,-3,1,"Now, I speak with some confidence of our plan, because I took over a state - California - 10% of the population of this nation - a state that, if it were a nation, would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world."
8948,-3,1,And that state we controlled spending.
8950,-3,1,"But at the same time, we gave back to the people of California - in tax rebates, tax credits, tax cuts - $5.7 billion."
8951,-3,1,I vetoed 993 measures without having a veto overturned.
8952,-3,1,"And among those vetoes, I stopped $16 billion in additional spending."
8956,-3,-1,"I believe the budget can be balanced by 1982 or 1983, and it is a combination of planned reduction of the tax increase that Carter has built into the economy, and that's what he's counting on for his plan."
8957,-3,-1,"But he's going to get a half-a-trillion dollars more over the next five years that he can use for additional programs, or hopefully, someplace down the line, balancing the budget."
8958,-3,-1,We believe that that's too much additional money to take out of the pockets of the people.
8960,-3,-1,"Mr. Moyers, I'm not here to debate Governor Reagan's record as Governor."
8962,-3,1,"But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office."
8964,-3,1,"more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government."
8965,-3,1,"But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans."
8967,-3,1,"In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military."
8968,-3,-1,And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up.
8970,-3,-1,"Well, some people look up figures, and some people make up figures."
8975,-3,1,"The truth of the matter is, we did cut the increase in spending in half."
8976,-3,1,It at the John doesn't quite realize - he's never held an executive position of that kind.
8978,-3,1,"And I can only tell him that we reduced, in proportion of other states, the per capita spending, the per capita size of Government - we only increased the size of Government one-twelfth what it had increased in the preceding eight years."
8979,-3,1,"And one journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, a respected newspaper, said there was no question about the fact that Governor Reagan had prevented the State of California from going bankrupt."
8991,-3,-1,"Oh, I'm it's my question."
8992,-3,-1,"But whether I agree or disagree with some individual, or what he may say, or how he may say it, I don't think there's any way that we can suggest that because people believe in God and go to church, that they should not want reflected in those people and those causes they support, their own belief in morality, and in the high traditions and principles which we've abandoned so much in this country."
8993,-3,-1,"Going around this country, I think that I have found a great hunger in America for a spiritual revival."
8995,-3,-1,For a return to traditions and values that we once had.
8999,-3,1,"I vetoed a number of bills of that kind myself, when I was in California."
9001,-3,-1,"But I do believe that no one in this country should be denied the right to express themselves, or to even try to persuade others to follow their leader."
9002,-3,-1,That's what elections are all about.
9010,-3,-1,I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual.
9014,-3,-1,I believe in freedom of choice.
9015,-3,-1,I don't believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that.
9016,-3,-1,I don't believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary.
9018,-3,1,"And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me - it's a very deeply personal matter."
9019,-3,-1,"But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong."
9020,-3,1,"And so, not once, but twice - in 1971 - I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools."
9022,-3,-1,"But I don't think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite."
9025,-3,-1,"Now, I don't think that's a bad idea."
9026,-3,-1,I think all of us should have a respect for innocent life.
9029,-3,-1,And I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born.
9030,-3,-1,"I I think that, technically, I know this is a difficult and an emotional problem, and many people sincerely feel on both sides of this, but I do believe that maybe we could find the answer through medical evidence, if we would determine once and for all, is an unborn child a human being?"
9031,-3,-1,I happen to believe it is.
9033,-3,-1,I also think that that unborn child has a right to be wanted.
9034,-3,-1,"And I also believe, sir, that the most personal intimate decision that any woman is ever called upon to make is the decision as to whether or not she shall carry a pregnancy to term."
9035,-3,-1,"And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual's conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor - any other counselor of her choice - I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual."
9038,-3,-1,And there might be some feeling of unfairness about this because he was not here to respond.
9040,-3,-1,And I want to express my appreciation to the League of Women Voters for adopting a course with which I believe the great majority of Americans are in agreement.
9042,-3,-1,"That it was placed here to be found by a special kind of people - people who had a special love for freedom and who had the courage to uproot themselves and leave hearth and homeland, and came to what, in the beginning, was the most undeveloped wilderness possible."
9046,-3,-1,"If wind, water or fire destroyed them, we built them again."
9047,-3,-1,"And in so doing, at the same time, we built a new breed of human called an American - a proud, an independent., and a most compassionate individual, for the most part."
9050,-3,-1,we're confronted with the horrendous problems that we've discussed here tonight.
9052,-3,-1,That the best is over.
9053,-3,-1,That we must cut back.
9054,-3,-1,That we must share in an ever-increasing scarcity.
9055,-3,-1,"That we must, in the failure to be able to protect our national security as it is today, we must not be provocative to any possible adversary."
9059,-3,-1,"The living Americans today have fought harder, paid a higher price for freedom, and done more to advance the dignity of man than any people who ever lived on this earth."
9062,-3,-1,I'm not running for the Presidency because I believe that I can solve the problems we've discussed tonight.
9064,-3,-1,"We can meet our destiny - and that destiny to build a land here that will be, for all mankind, a shining city on a hill."
9065,-3,-1,I think we ought to get at it.
9067,-3,-1,"Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties."
9069,-3,-1,"We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue."
9070,-3,-1,"I respect him for showing tonight - for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me."
9072,-3,-1,I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems.
9073,-3,-1,"If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy?"
9074,-3,1,Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable?
9075,-3,-1,Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be?
9077,-3,-1,I don't think you do think that.
9078,-3,-1,"And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980."
9080,-3,-1,"It's been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes."
9081,-3,-1,We've got to stop drifting.
9082,-3,-1,What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important.
9085,-3,-1,"If we don't resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant."
9086,-3,-1,"The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be?"
9139,-3,1,"If you graduated in the top quarter of your airlines, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship, four years tuition free in the college of your choice in Massachusetts, it's a public institution."
9142,-3,-1,But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school.
9146,-3,1,"With half of college kids graduating this year without a college -- excuse me, without a job."
9151,-3,-1,I know what it takes to create good jobs again.
9154,-3,-1,It's not going to be like the last four years.
9156,-3,-1,"I know what it takes to bring them back, and I'm going to do that, and make sure that when you graduate -- when do you graduate?"
9159,-3,-1,"When you come out in 2014, I presume I'm going to be president."
9160,-3,-1,I'm going to make sure you get a job.
9166,-3,-1,"Not just to you, but to the entire nation."
9167,-3,-1,"Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country."
9168,-3,-1,"But not just jobs, good paying jobs."
9169,-3,-1,Ones that can support a family.
9171,-3,-1,And there are a bunch of things we can do to make sure your future is bright.
9177,-3,-1,"Number two, we've got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world."
9178,-3,1,"And the fact that you're going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education and we've worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you, but I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are out there right now and the jobs of the future."
9185,-3,-1,"We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright but America's future is going to bright as well."
9207,-3,-1,"So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did."
9214,-3,1,And we would have lost a million jobs.
9226,-3,1,That's what's been squeezing middle class families.
9241,-3,-1,The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy.
9242,-3,-1,So here's what I've done since I've been president.
9248,-3,1,That's why we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars.
9251,-3,1,And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.
9252,-3,-1,"Now, I want to build on that."
9257,-3,-1,"But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficiency energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower."
9259,-3,0,"So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part."
9260,-3,-1,"And if we are only thinking about tomorrow or the next day and not thinking about 10 years from now, we're not going to control our own economic future."
9263,-3,-1,I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States.
9264,-3,-1,That's going to help Jeremy get a job.
9265,-3,-1,It's also going to make sure that you're not paying as much for gas.
9267,-3,-1,"Well, let's look at the president's policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we've had four years of policies being played out."
9268,-3,1,"And the president's right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land."
9274,-3,-1,What was his participation there?
9276,-3,-1,And what was the cost?
9278,-3,-1,"Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables."
9282,-3,-1,Talk to the people that are working in those industries.
9284,-3,0,"People grabbed my arms and said, ""Please save my job."""
9291,-3,1,"Because our energy is low cost, that are already beginning to come back because of our abundant energy."
9304,-3,1,We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration and my -- the previous president was an oil man.
9307,-3,0,"And when I hear Governor Romney say he's a big coal guy, I mean, keep in mind, when -- Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, ""This plant kills,"" and took great pride in shutting it down."
9308,-3,-1,And now suddenly you're a big champion of coal.
9311,-3,1,"Same thing with oil, same thing with natural gas."
9319,-3,1,"In the last four years, you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half."
9327,-3,-1,"Governor Romney, here's what we did."
9328,-3,-1,There were a whole bunch of oil companies.
9330,-3,-1,"No, no, I had a question and the question was how much did you cut them by?"
9331,-3,-1,You want me to answer a question --
9337,-3,1,You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they weren't using.
9362,-3,-1,And the answer is I don't believe people think that's the case --
9370,-3,1,"If you're paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working."
9372,-3,1,"When the president took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about $1.86 a gallon."
9381,-3,-1,"Well, think about what the governor -- think about what the governor just said."
9382,-3,1,"He said when I took office, the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86."
9387,-3,1,"And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about, we've -- we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire earth once."
9388,-3,-1,"So, I'm all for pipelines."
9392,-3,1,"When you've got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican senator in that -- in Iowa is all for it, providing tax breaks (ph) to help this work and Governor Romney says I'm opposed."
9414,-3,-1,I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country.
9419,-3,-1,We'll bring back manufacturing to America.
9422,-3,-1,"Candy, it's not going to --"
9438,-3,1,And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.
9439,-3,1,"You've seen, as middle-income people in this country, incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000."
9440,-3,1,"Health insurance premiums, up $2,500."
9444,-3,-1,So I want to get some relief to middle-income families.
9448,-3,1,The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.
9450,-3,1,Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.
9453,-3,1,"But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains."
9455,-3,-1,That makes life a lot easier.
9456,-3,1,"If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because there'll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains."
9460,-3,-1,"And I will not -- I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that's being paid by the highest income taxpayers."
9465,-3,-1,I will not let that happen.
9466,-3,1,"I want to get us on track to a balanced budget, and I'm going to reduce the tax burden on middle income families."
9467,-3,-1,And what's that going to do?
9470,-3,-1,My philosophy on taxes has been simple.
9471,-3,-1,"And that is, I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle-class some relief."
9472,-3,-1,Because they have been hit hard over the last decade.
9474,-3,0,So four years ago I stood on a stage just like this one.
9477,-3,1,And we've cut them 18 times.
9478,-3,-1,"And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families, and for small business."
9481,-3,1,"And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase."
9485,-3,1,We created 23 million new jobs.
9488,-3,0,"Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy."
9489,-3,0,"He was on 60 Minutes just two weeks ago and he was asked: Is it fair for somebody like you, making $20 million a year, to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a bus driver, somebody making $50,000 year?"
9492,-3,-1,"Well, I fundamentally disagree with that."
9499,-3,-1,And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's striving for everybody.
9502,-3,0,You heard what I said about my tax plan.
9508,-3,-1,"And for me, this is about jobs."
9511,-3,1,"So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people."
9512,-3,-1,"For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment."
9513,-3,-1,We can do better than this.
9518,-3,-1,My five-point plan does it.
9519,-3,-1,Energy independence for North America in five years.
9520,-3,-1,"Opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America."
9521,-3,-1,Cracking down on China when they cheat.
9523,-3,-1,Fixing our training programs for our workers.
9524,-3,-1,"And finally, championing small business."
9525,-3,-1,I want to make small businesses grow and thrive.
9526,-1,-1,I know how to make that happen.
9529,-3,-1,And they're going now because of the policies of this administration.
9534,-3,1,"Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board, 20 percent."
9536,-3,1,Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs even though the military's not asking for them.
9538,-3,1,He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.
9539,-3,1,That's another trillion dollars -- that's $8 trillion.
9550,-3,-1,You're going to be paying for it.
9563,-3,1,"When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years, $5 trillion?"
9575,-3,-1,Because I'm offsetting some of the reductions with holding down some of the deductions.
9593,-3,-1,And she worked hard every day and made a lot of sacrifices to make sure we got everything we needed.
9595,-3,0,"She never got a college education, even though she was smart as a whip."
9597,-3,0,She trained people who would end up becoming her bosses during the course of her career.
9599,-3,-1,That's not what you did in that generation.
9607,-3,-1,"Well, the truth of the matter is, is that that's exactly what we've done."
9612,-3,-1,"But we've got to enforce the laws, which is what we are doing, and we've also got to make sure that in every walk of life we do not tolerate discrimination."
9614,-3,-1,I'm going to continue to push on this issue for the next four years.
9621,-3,0,And -- and so we -- we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.
9622,-3,0,"I went to a number of women's groups and said, ""Can you help us find folks,"" and they brought us whole binders full of women."
9625,-3,-1,"But number two, because I recognized that if you're going to have women in the workforce that sometimes you need to be more flexible."
9626,-3,0,"My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school."
9628,-3,0,I need to be able to get home at 5 o'clock so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.
9631,-3,-1,"We're going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy I'm going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers they're going to be anxious to hire women."
9634,-3,1,"We're still down 580,000 jobs."
9636,-3,1,"What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers that are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford."
9646,-3,0,"He said, ""I'll get back to you."""
9651,-3,-1,I think that's a mistake.
9652,-3,1,"In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody who is insured."
9658,-3,1,"When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country, who rely on Planned Parenthood for, not just contraceptive care, they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings."
9661,-3,-1,"When we talk about child care, and the credits that we're providing."
9682,-3,-1,I want to make sure our timekeepers are working here.
9688,-3,-1,I'd just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not.
9689,-3,-1,And I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not.
9699,-3,1,It's been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time.
9701,-3,-1,"Number three, I'm going to get us to a balanced budget."
9707,-3,-1,"And then let's take the last one, championing small business."
9708,-3,-1,Our party has been focused too long.
9710,-3,-1,I understand how hard it is to start a small business.
9712,-3,-1,I want to keep their taxes down on small business.
9713,-3,-1,"I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it."
9717,-3,-1,And President Bush has a very different path for a very different time.
9727,-3,1,That's what took us from surplus to deficit.
9737,-3,1,George Bush didn't propose turning Medicare into a voucher.
9738,-3,1,George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform.
9739,-3,0,He didn't call for self-deportation.
9741,-3,-1,"In some ways, he's gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy."
9742,-3,-1,And I think that's a mistake.
9743,-3,-1,That's not how we're going to move our economy forward.
9755,-3,1,"I told you I'd cut taxes for small businesses, and I have."
9757,-3,-1,"I said we'd refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after Al Qaeda's leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead."
9758,-3,1,"I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can't jerk you around and if you don't have health insurance, that you'd have a chance to get affordable insurance, and I have."
9762,-3,-1,"Now, does that mean you're not struggling?"
9764,-3,-1,A lot of us are.
9765,-3,-1,"And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars, to rebuild America and putting people back to work."
9766,-3,-1,"Making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not only the energy of today, but also the energy of the future."
9767,-3,1,"All of those things will make a difference, so the point is the commitments I've made, I've kept."
9770,-3,-1,And I suspect he'll keep those too.
9783,-3,-1,Make sure your kids can go to college.
9784,-3,-1,"Make sure that you are getting a good paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security... (CROSSTALK)"
9788,-3,-1,...will be there for you.
9791,-3,-1,I think you know better.
9792,-3,-1,I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the president just described and that you don't feel like your confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.
9793,-3,-1,"I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get."
9794,-3,-1,You're going to get a repeat of the last four years.
9797,-3,1,The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work.
9807,-3,-1,This is a president who has not been able to do what he said he'd do.
9810,-3,1,"In fact, he doubled it."
9811,-3,1,"He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year."
9814,-3,-1,The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a president who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again.
9825,-3,-1,The president wants to do well.
9827,-3,1,"But the policies he's put in place from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies, these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have."
9833,-3,-1,He's great as a -- as a -- as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision.
9834,-3,-1,"That's wonderful, except we have a record to look at."
9837,-3,-1,That's what this election is about.
9838,-3,-1,It's about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve.
9845,-3,-1,This is for Governor Romney?
9858,-3,-1,Did I get that right?
9861,-3,-1,And let me step back and tell you what I would like to do with our immigration policy broadly and include an answer to your question.
9863,-3,1,We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.
9864,-3,0,My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Ann's dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American.
9869,-3,-1,I don't think you have to -- shouldn't have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally.
9871,-3,1,"People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma, come to the U.S. of A."
9873,-3,-1,"Number two, we're going to have to stop illegal immigration."
9878,-3,-1,I won't put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.
9881,-3,1,"Now when the president ran for office, he said that he'd put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation -- he'd file a bill in his first year that would reform our -- our immigration system, protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration."
9884,-3,1,Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come legally and for those that are here illegally today?
9889,-3,-1,We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.
9890,-3,-1,People are willing to take risks.
9892,-3,0,But we're also a nation of laws.
9896,-3,-1,They'll make things happen to create jobs here in the United States.
9898,-3,-1,"What I've also said is if we're going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gang bangers, people who are hurting the community, not after students, not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families."
9899,-3,-1,And that's what we've done.
9900,-3,-1,"And what I've also said is for young people who come here, brought here often times by their parents."
9903,-3,-1,Understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers.
9908,-3,-1,Making life so miserable on folks that they'll leave.
9910,-3,1,Part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers.
9912,-3,-1,"If my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want -- I don't want to empower somebody like that."
9913,-3,-1,"So, we can fix this system in a comprehensive way."
9914,-3,-1,"And when Governor Romney says, the challenge is, ""Well Obama didn't try."""
9917,-3,-1,"And I said, let's fix this system."
9918,-3,-1,Including Senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.
9935,-3,1,Four years ago you said in your first year you would file legislation.
9938,-3,-1,My -- my view is that this president should have honored his promise to do as he said.
9941,-3,-1,Instead let people make their own choice.
9943,-3,-1,But I'm not in favor of rounding up people and -- and -- and taking them out of this country.
9964,-3,-1,Have you looked at your pension?
9966,-3,-1,"Mr. President, have you looked at your pension?"
9968,-3,-1,It's not as big as yours so it doesn't take as long.
9969,-3,-1,"Well, let me give you some advice."
9973,-3,1,You also have investments in Chinese companies.
9975,-3,1,You also have investments through a Cayman's trust.
9993,-3,-1,"Now, we've got to make sure that we do it in a smart way and a comprehensive way, and we make the legal system better."
10002,-3,-1,This used to be a bipartisan issue.
10019,-3,0,"I send them there, oftentimes into harm's way."
10022,-3,0,"So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team and I gave them three instructions."
10023,-3,-1,"Number one, beef up our security and procedures, not just in Libya, but at every embassy and consulate in the region."
10024,-3,-1,"Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure folks are held accountable and it doesn't happen again."
10025,-3,-1,"And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we're going to hunt them down, because one of the things that I've said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them."
10028,-3,-1,You don't turn national security into a political issue.
10030,-3,-1,And people -- not everybody agrees with some of the decisions I've made.
10031,-3,-1,"But when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say."
10032,-3,1,"I said I'd end the war in Libya -- in -- in Iraq, and I did."
10033,-3,1,"I said that we'd go after al-Qaeda and bin Laden, we have."
10034,-3,1,"I said we'd transition out of Afghanistan, and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security, that's what I'm doing."
10036,-3,-1,"And I am ultimately responsible for what's taking place there because these are my folks, and I'm the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home."
10050,-3,-1,How could we have not known?
10052,-3,0,I think these -- these actions taken by a president and a leader have symbolic significance and perhaps even material significance in that you'd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.
10055,-3,1,This was an attack by terrorists.
10057,-3,-1,"Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya."
10059,-3,-1,We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb.
10068,-3,0,"I'm the president and I'm always responsible, and that's why nobody's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do."
10071,-3,0,"And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base and grieving with the families."
10084,-3,1,I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.
10095,-3,-1,"And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard, on Sunday, the -- your secretary --"
10100,-3,-1,-- this was a spontaneous --
10108,-3,-1,"I'm happy to do that, too."
10120,-3,0,"You know, just a couple of weeks ago, actually, probably about a month, I saw a mother, who I had met at the bedside of her son, who had been shot in that theater."
10121,-3,0,And her son had been shot through the head.
10123,-3,-1,But there were a lot of families who didn't have that good fortune and whose sons or daughters or husbands didn't survive.
10124,-3,-1,"So my belief is that, (A), we have to enforce the laws we've already got, make sure that we're keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill. We've done a much better job in terms of background checks, but we've got more to do when it comes to enforcement."
10127,-3,-1,Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced.
10130,-3,1,They're using cheap hand guns.
10134,-3,-1,But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur.
10136,-3,-1,"Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal."
10139,-3,-1,And you ask how -- how are we going to do that?
10147,-3,-1,"We need moms and dads, helping to raise kids."
10149,-3,-1,"A lot of great single moms, single dads."
10150,-3,-1,"But gosh to tell our kids that before they have babies, they ought to think about getting married to someone, that's a great idea."
10151,-3,1,"Because if there's a two parent family, the prospect of living in poverty goes down dramatically."
10155,-3,1,"Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don't know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were -- were given to people that ultimately gave them to -- to drug lords."
10160,-3,1,"Which I think the American people would like to understand fully, it's been investigated to a degree, but -- but the administration has carried out executive privilege to prevent all of the information from coming out."
10168,-3,1,"And it's referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together, because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted."
10171,-3,-1,What we have right now in Washington is a place that's gridlocked.
10180,-3,-1,So that's on the record.
10182,-3,-1,We're not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed and we have got to make sure they don't get weapons.
10189,-3,1,Giving them access to higher education.
10190,-3,1,"As I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they weren't able to get before."
10201,-3,-1,This is part of the choice in this election.
10211,-3,-1,... and reduce our violence.
10221,-3,-1,It used to be the United States of America.
10223,-3,1,A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years.
10226,-3,-1,We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.
10227,-3,-1,What I will do as president is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again.
10229,-3,-1,"It's not by trickle-down government, saying we're going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations."
10231,-3,-1,"I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business, to invest and grow in America."
10236,-3,1,And that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.
10238,-3,1,And manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can't compete.
10239,-3,0,China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years.
10242,-3,-1,So we're going to make sure that people we trade with around the world play by the rules.
10243,-3,-1,But let me -- let me not just stop there.
10245,-3,-1,"That's why I want to down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here."
10246,-3,1,Canada's tax rate on companies is now 15 percent.
10254,-3,-1,"I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it."
10256,-3,-1,My priority is making sure that we get more people hired.
10258,-3,1,The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high.
10265,-3,1,"I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China; that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore."
10268,-3,1,"One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say, if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don't have to pay U.S. taxes."
10269,-3,1,"But, of course, if you're a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you've got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney's talking about."
10277,-3,1,That's creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country.
10278,-3,-1,"That's why we've kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal."
10279,-3,0,"Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated."
10285,-3,1,That's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency.
10294,-3,-1,One by holding down the value of their currency.
10295,-3,-1,"Number two, by stealing our intellectual property; our designs, our patents, our technology."
10296,-3,0,"There's even an Apple store in China that's a counterfeit Apple store, selling counterfeit goods."
10301,-3,-1,The president's characterization of my tax plan...
10311,-3,-1,"Because they are low wage, low skill jobs."
10317,-3,-1,If we're not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country.
10319,-3,1,"Those investments are what's going to help to make sure that we continue to lead this world economy, not just next year, but 10 years from now, 50 years from now, 100 years from now."
10334,-3,-1,"In the nature of a campaign, it seems that some campaigns are focused on attacking a person rather than prescribing their own future and the things they'd like to do."
10336,-3,-1,I care about 100 percent of the American people.
10339,-3,-1,I understand what it takes to make a bright and prosperous future for America again.
10343,-3,-1,And I believe we're all children of the same God.
10344,-3,-1,I believe we have a responsibility to care for one another.
10345,-3,0,I -- I served as a missionary for my church.
10347,-3,0,I've sat across the table from people who were out of work and worked with them to try and find new work or to help them through tough times.
10350,-3,1,"I was able also to get our schools ranked number one in the nation, so 100 percent of our kids would have a bright opportunity for a future."
10351,-3,-1,I understand that I can get this country on track again.
10352,-3,-1,We don't have to settle for what we're going through.
10358,-3,-1,"If I become president, I'll get America working again."
10366,-3,-1,I'll get our incomes up.
10370,-3,-1,"Barry, I think a lot of this campaign, maybe over the last four years, has been devoted to this nation that I think government creates jobs, that that somehow is the answer."
10371,-3,-1,That's not what I believe.
10373,-3,-1,I believe in self-reliance and individual initiative and risk takers being rewarded.
10374,-3,-1,"But I also believe that everybody should have a fair shot and everybody should do their fair share and everybody should play by the same rules, because that's how our economy's grown."
10376,-3,-1,And -- and that is part of what's at stake in this election.
10377,-3,-1,There's a fundamentally different vision about how we move our country forward.
10388,-3,-1,"Because if they succeed, I believe the country succeeds."
10391,-3,-1,That was something that advanced the entire country.
10392,-3,-1,And I want to make sure that the next generation has those same opportunities.
10393,-3,-1,That's why I'm asking for your vote and that's why I'm asking for another four years.
10454,-3,1,It means that we are helping state and local governments set up road projects and bridge projects that keep people in their jobs.
10480,-3,-1,"I know how the do that, my friends."
10493,-3,-1,"You know, that's a tough question and there's a lot of qualified Americans."
10495,-3,0,A supporter of Senator Obama's is Warren Buffett.
10501,-3,-1,But the point is it's going to have to be somebody who inspires trust and confidence.
10506,-3,-1,But there are other folks out there.
10524,-3,0,"I left my campaign and suspended it to go back to Washington to make sure that there were additional protections for the taxpayer in the form of good oversight, in the form of taxpayers being the first to be paid back when our economy recovers -- and it will recover -- and a number of other measures."
10542,-3,1,"Right now, the credit markets are frozen up and what that means, as a practical matter, is that small businesses and some large businesses just can't get loans."
10545,-3,-1,"And if you imagine just one company trying to deal with that, now imagine a million companies all across the country."
10568,-3,-1,"No, I am confident about the American economy."
10595,-3,-1,"Well, look, I understand your frustration and your cynicism, because while you've been carrying out your responsibilities -- most of the people here, you've got a family budget."
10598,-3,-1,Maybe you put off buying a new car.
10613,-3,-1,We've got to reform health care to help you and your budget.
10616,-3,-1,We've got to have a different energy plan.
10617,-3,-1,We've got to invest in college affordability.
10643,-3,-1,"My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?"
10644,-3,-1,I think you have to look at my record and you have to look at his.
10667,-3,-1,"We have to have all of the above, alternative fuels, wind, tide, solar, natural gas, clean coal technology."
10690,-3,-1,"But just one point I want to make, Tom."
10698,-3,-1,And so we've got to prioritize both our spending side and our tax policies to make sure that they're working for you.
10708,-3,1,I first proposed a long time ago that we would have to examine every agency and every bureaucracy of government.
10715,-3,-1,And they'll have to undergo the same scrutiny that all projects should in competition with others.
10731,-3,-1,"And so it's important to understand that the -- I think the American people are hungry for the kind of leadership that is going to tackle these problems not just in government, but outside of government."
10732,-3,-1,"And let's take the example of energy, which we already spoke about."
10739,-3,-1,"And one of the things I want to do is make sure that we're providing incentives so that you can buy a fuel efficient car that's made right here in the United States of America, not in Japan or South Korea, making sure that you are able to weatherize your home or make your business more fuel efficient."
10741,-3,-1,And the last point I just want to make.
10747,-3,-1,"Well, I think it starts with Washington."
10750,-3,-1,"It means -- and I have to, again, repeat this."
10752,-3,1,"I mean, Senator McCain has been talking tough about earmarks, and that's good, but earmarks account for about $18 billion of our budget."
10756,-3,-1,"And that's why I think it's important for the president to set a tone that says all of us are going to contribute, all of us are going to make sacrifices, and it means that, yes, we may have to cut some spending, although I disagree with Senator McCain about an across-the- board freeze."
10776,-3,-1,And let's not raise anybody's taxes.
10778,-3,-1,"Tom, can I respond to this briefly?"
10798,-3,0,"Now, Senator McCain talks about small businesses."
10801,-3,1,"And we provide a 50 percent tax credit so that they can buy health insurance for their workers, because there are an awful lot of small businesses that I meet across America that want to do right by their workers but they just can't afford it."
10816,-3,-1,Social Security is not that tough.
10826,-3,-1,It's going to be a little tougher because we're talking about very complex and difficult issues.
10832,-3,1,Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts.
10836,-3,-1,So let's look at our record.
10856,-3,-1,"That's the good news, my friends."
10881,-3,0,What Senator McCain doesn't mention is he's been there 26 of them.
10884,-3,-1,One last point I want to make on energy.
10900,-3,-1,"I think once it gets into productive stages, that we ought to, obviously, turn it over to the private sector."
10902,-3,1,"It was an energy bill on the floor of the Senate loaded down with goodies, billions for the oil companies, and it was sponsored by Bush and Cheney."
10903,-3,-1,You know who voted for it?
10911,-3,-1,"But the point is, also, on oil drilling, oil drilling offshore now is vital so that we can bridge the gap."
10928,-3,1,And your co-payments and deductibles have gone up 30 percent just in the last year alone.
10937,-3,1,That will reduce medical errors and reduce costs.
10963,-3,1,"If you're a small business person and you don't insure your employees, Senator Obama will fine you."
10979,-3,-1,"We can do it by giving them, as a start, a $5,000 refundable tax credit to go around and get the health insurance policy of their choice."
10990,-3,-1,"But they certainly are a little nervous when Senator Obama says, if you don't get the health care policy that I think you should have, then you're going to get fined."
11000,-3,1,"Number one, let me just repeat, if you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it."
11002,-3,1,You'll still have choice of doctor.
11009,-3,-1,"And the reason that it's a problem to go shopping state by state, you know what insurance companies will do?"
11012,-3,1,"Everybody goes to Delaware, because they've got very -- pretty loose laws when it comes to things like credit cards."
11020,-3,-1,I don't believe that -- did we hear the size of the fine?
11032,-3,-1,"But the challenge is to know when the United States of American can beneficially effect the outcome of a crisis, when to go in and when not, when American military power is worth the expenditure of our most precious treasure."
11048,-3,1,But it's also put an enormous strain on our budget.
11052,-3,-1,"Now, Senator McCain and I do agree, this is the greatest nation on earth."
11054,-3,1,But there has never been a nation in the history of the world that saw its economy decline and maintained its military superiority.
11068,-3,-1,That's why it's so important for us to be able to work in concert with our allies.
11101,-3,-1,I believe that part of the reason we have a difficult situation is because we made a bad judgment going into Iraq in the first place when we hadn't finished the job of hunting down bin Laden and crushing al Qaeda.
11106,-3,1,They are plotting to kill Americans right now.
11109,-3,-1,But I do believe that we have to change our policies with Pakistan.
11118,-3,0,"Teddy Roosevelt used to say walk softly -- talk softly, but carry a big stick."
11122,-3,-1,"You know, if you are a country and you're trying to gain the support of another country, then you want to do everything you can that they would act in a cooperative fashion."
11124,-3,-1,"Now, let me just go back with you very briefly."
11149,-3,-1,"You're doing a great job, Tom."
11158,-3,-1,"That I don't think is an example of ""speaking softly."""
11176,-3,-1,"I'll get Osama bin Laden, my friends."
11194,-3,-1,I don't think he has to be a dictator.
11201,-3,-1,"Of course, we have to do some things tactically, some of which Senator Obama is correct on."
11208,-3,1,"And once they feel secure, then they lead normal, social, economic, political lives, the same thing that's happening in Iraq today."
11214,-3,-1,"First of all, as I say, I don't think that -- we're not going to have another Cold War with Russia."
11219,-3,-1,"He has gradually repressed most of the liberties that we would expect for nations to observe, and he has exhibited most aggressive behavior, obviously, in Georgia."
11222,-3,-1,We've got to show moral support for Georgia.
11226,-3,-1,"And so, of course we want to bring international pressures to bear on Russia in hopes that that will modify and eventually change their behavior."
11238,-3,-1,Georgia in particular is now on the brink of enormous economic challenges.
11244,-3,-1,"So part of the job of the next commander-in-chief, in keeping all of you safe, is making sure that we can see some of the 21st Century challenges and anticipate them before they happen."
11249,-3,-1,We've got to be much more strategic if we're going to be able to deal with all of the challenges that we face out there.
11250,-3,-1,And one last point I want to make about Russia.
11262,-3,-1,Depends on how we respond to Russia and it depends on a lot of things.
11268,-3,-1,"But the Russians, I think we can deal with them but they've got to understand that they're facing a very firm and determined United States of America that will defend our interests and that of other countries in the world."
11292,-3,-1,"I want to make sure that the Iranians are put enough -- that we put enough pressure on the Iranians by joining with our allies, imposing significant, tough sanctions to modify their behavior."
11297,-3,-1,"Well, Terry, first of all, we honor your service, and we're grateful for it."
11307,-3,-1,That starts putting the squeeze on them.
11308,-3,-1,"Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks -- not just with our friends, but also with our enemies -- to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you don't change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences."
11310,-3,-1,"Now, it may not work."
11314,-3,1,North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability.
11329,-3,0,I came from very modest means.
11331,-3,0,"Despite all that, I was able to go to the best schools on earth and I was able to succeed in a way that I could not have succeeded anywhere else in this country."
11335,-3,1,Wages and incomes have gone down.
11362,-3,-1,I believe in its future.
11363,-3,-1,I believe in its greatness.
11397,-3,-1,What's in the best interests of our people?
11399,-3,-1,Is it in our nation's interests?
11400,-3,-1,Peace in the Middle East is in our nation's interests.
11406,-3,-1,He's a vice presidential nominee who represents -- I think people got to see why I picked him.
11408,-3,0,One of the things I've done in Texas is I've been able to put together a good team of people.
11410,-3,-1,"The goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind, Medicare for our seniors, a Social Security system that's safe and secure, foreign policy that's in our nation's interest, and a strong military, and then bring people together to achieve those goals."
11416,-3,-1,I see it as a question of values.
11418,-3,-1,And I don't think that's just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as Americans.
11421,-3,-1,So I think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union.
11426,-3,-1,We've got to deal with things like racial profiling.
11427,-3,-1,And we have to keep our military strong.
11429,-3,-1,"But our real power comes, I think, from our values."
11433,-3,-1,I don't think they'll look at us with envy.
11434,-3,-1,It really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy.
11435,-3,-1,"If we're an arrogant nation, they'll resent us."
11437,-3,-1,"And it's -- our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power, and that's why we have to be humble."
11438,-3,-1,And yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom.
11439,-3,-1,So I don't think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are.
11448,-3,-1,We have to protect our capacity to push forward what America's all about.
11449,-3,-1,"That means not only military strength and our values, it also means keeping our economy strong."
11450,-3,1,"You know, in the last, or two decades ago, it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because it's causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world, and we were lectured to all the time."
11457,-3,-1,I think we ought to be forgiving Third World debt under certain conditions.
11462,-3,-1,We shouldn't be lending money to corrupt officials.
11474,-3,-1,It's a very tense situation there.
11478,-3,-1,And we just have to take it day-to-day right now.
11482,-3,-1,And our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd.
11486,-3,-1,I think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the Middle East.
11488,-3,-1,I'm going to stand by Israel.
11490,-3,-1,It's important to be friends with people when you don't need each other so that when you do there's a strong bond of friendship.
11493,-3,1,The sanctions are being violated.
11495,-3,-1,He better not be or there's going to be a consequence should I be the president.
11496,-3,-1,But it's important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resolute in your determination.
11500,-3,-1,I hope to get a sense of should I be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the Middle East.
11508,-3,-1,"I do think this, though."
11509,-3,-1,When it comes to timetables it can't be the United States timetable as to how discussions take place.
11512,-3,-1,"And therefore, the term honest broker makes sense."
11520,-3,-1,"I think that, you know, I would hope to be able to convince people I could handle the Iraqi situation better."
11522,-3,-1,"I would like to, of course, and I presume this administration would as well."
11525,-3,-1,We don't want him fishing in troubled waters in the Middle East.
11529,-3,0,"Well, when I got to be a part of the current administration, it was right after -- I was one of the few members of my political party to support former President Bush in the Persian Gulf War resolution, and at the end of that war, for whatever reason, it was not finished in a way that removed Saddam Hussein from power."
11530,-3,-1,I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations.
11532,-3,1,And we have maintained the sanctions.
11535,-3,1,"I know the governor's not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, I'm told, except for three where they notified, and they're trying to break out of the box, there's no question about it."
11536,-3,-1,I don't think they should be allowed to.
11538,-3,-1,"No, of course not, absolutely not, I want them to be tougher."
11544,-3,0,I supported them when they did so.
11558,-3,-1,It is important for NATO to have it work.
11572,-3,-1,He should be held accountable.
11573,-3,-1,"Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor."
11575,-3,-1,"Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved."
11576,-3,-1,"But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think it's based on our values."
11577,-3,-1,"Now, have I got that wrong?"
11579,-3,-1,If I think it's in our nation's strategic interest I'll commit troops.
11580,-3,-1,"I thought it was in our strategic interests to keep Milosevic in check because of our relations in NATO, and that's why I took the position I took."
11581,-3,-1,I think it's important for NATO to be strong and confident.
11582,-3,-1,"I felt like unchecked Milosevic would harm NATO, and so it depends on the situation, Mr. Vice President."
11592,-3,-1,I thought that was a mistake.
11600,-3,-1,"Of course, and that again -- no, I think that that was ill-considered."
11601,-3,0,I did support it at the time.
11602,-3,-1,"It was in the previous administration, in the Bush-Quayle administration, and I think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very, very seriously."
11620,-3,-1,I think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when it's in our best interests.
11641,-3,-1,"The administration, seems like we're having a great love fest tonight, but the administration made the right decision on training Nigerian troops for situations just such as this in Rwanda, and so I thought they made the right decision not to send U.S. troops into Rwanda."
11643,-3,-1,"I'd like to come back to the question of nation building, but let me address the question directly, first."
11646,-3,0,"My wife Tipper, who is here, actually went on a military plane with General Sholicatchvieli on one of those flights."
11649,-3,-1,"But I do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason, Jim."
11650,-3,-1,"One of the criteria that I think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved, if we can really make the difference with military forces."
11651,-3,-1,"If we tried everything else, if we have allies."
11660,-3,-1,We have to work with Nigeria.
11663,-3,-1,"And those are my four top priorities should I be the president, not to say we won't be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity."
11664,-3,-1,"I thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was East Timor when we provided logistical support to the Australians, support that only we can provide."
11667,-3,-1,And I think that's where maybe the vice president and I begin to have some differences.
11668,-3,-1,I'm worried about overcommitting our military around the world.
11669,-3,-1,I want to be judicious in its use.
11672,-3,-1,I didn't think it was a mission worthwhile.
11677,-3,-1,I would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of American troops overseas.
11678,-3,-1,I think we have to be very reticent about that.
11680,-3,-1,"The way I see it, the world is getting much closer together."
11681,-3,-1,"Like it or not, we are now -- the United States is now the natural leader of the world."
11682,-3,-1,All these other countries are looking to us.
11685,-3,-1,"This idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase, but think about the great conflict of the past century, World War II."
11687,-3,-1,"The lesson was that in the aftermath of World War I, we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became World War II."
11691,-3,-1,And what did we do in the late '40's and '50's and '60's?
11694,-3,0,But it was also military.
11695,-3,-1,And the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there.
11702,-3,-1,And we can't do that.
11704,-3,1,But one of the problems we have in the military is we're in a lot of places around the world.
11706,-3,-1,I would very much like to get our troops out of there.
11713,-3,-1,"Now there are some places where I think -- you know, I've supported the administration in Columbia."
11715,-3,-1,The hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful Columbia.
11720,-3,-1,I think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations.
11722,-3,-1,"I mean, we're going to have kind of a nation building core from America?"
11724,-3,-1,Our military is meant to fight and win war.
11725,-3,-1,That's what it's meant to do.
11727,-3,-1,"I strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the Korean peninsula, not only to keep the peace in the peninsula, but to keep regional stability."
11728,-3,-1,"And I strongly believe we need to keep a presence in NATO, but I'm going to be judicious as to how to use the military."
11729,-3,-1,"It needs to be in our vital interest, the mission needs to be clear, and the extra strategy obvious."
11730,-3,-1,I don't disagree with that.
11731,-3,-1,"I certainly don't disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the Balkans as soon as we can, as soon as the mission is complete."
11734,-3,-1,"And Haitians have their problems, but we gave them a chance to restore democracy."
11737,-3,-1,"And as for this idea of nation building, the phrase sounds grandiose."
11755,-3,-1,I think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform.
11756,-3,-1,"I think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way, and there's some pretty egregious examples recently."
11761,-3,-1,But I don't think the IMF ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves.
11762,-3,-1,So I'll look at every place where we're investing money.
11770,-3,0,The governor mentioned it earlier.
11771,-3,0,I've worked on this issue.
11772,-3,-1,"It's an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies, like militaries and police departments around the world, customs officials, that's one of the worst forms of it."
11774,-3,-1,"I just think, Jim, that this is an absolutely unique period in world history."
11776,-3,-1,And we have a fundamental choice to make.
11783,-3,-1,I'm not so sure the role of the United States is to go around the world and say this is the way it's got to be.
11786,-3,-1,I want to empower the people.
11787,-3,-1,"I want to help people help themselves, not have government tell people what to do."
11788,-3,-1,"I just don't think it's the role of the United States to walk into a country and say, ""we do it this way, so should you."" I think we can help."
11791,-3,1,"We went into Russia, we said here is some IMF money, and it ended up in Viktor Chemomyrdin's pocket, and others, and yet we played like there was reform."
11792,-3,-1,The only people that are going to reform Russia are Russia.
11813,-3,0,And I was surprised at the extent of it.
11814,-3,-1,And I think we've now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this.
11815,-3,-1,"Imagine what it -- what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity."
11819,-3,-1,"Yeah, I can't imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed."
11820,-3,-1,"That's just flat wrong, and that's not what America is all about."
11826,-3,-1,I don't think they ought to be held guilty.
11833,-3,-1,"And I also agree that most police officers, of course, are doing a good job and hate this practice also."
11834,-3,0,"I talked to an African-American police officer in Springfield, Massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training."
11839,-3,-1,And that's why I think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law.
11840,-3,-1,I think these crimes are different.
11841,-3,-1,"I think they're different because they're based on prejudice and hatred, which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim, but they're intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people."
11864,-3,-1,"It's the very few that create most of the crises, and we just have to find them and deal with them."
11867,-3,-1,Let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes.
11868,-3,-1,In public education when we just move children through the schools.
11869,-3,0,"My friend, Phyllis Hunter, is here."
11875,-3,-1,It starts with making sure every child learns to read.
11877,-3,-1,Curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum.
11881,-3,-1,"We can close an achievement gap, and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability, Jim."
11887,-3,-1,"And I believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money, any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children, for example, you must show us whether or not the children are learning."
11888,-3,-1,"And if they are, fine."
11889,-3,-1,"And if they're not, there has to be a consequence."
11890,-3,-1,And so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education.
11893,-3,-1,"Well, I think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws."
11894,-3,-1,I think we still need affirmative action.
11902,-3,-1,Am I wrong about that?
11910,-3,-1,"In this case when you murder somebody it's hate, Jim."
11913,-3,-1,I'm not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty.
11927,-3,0,"But let me say to you, Mr. Vice President, we're happy with our laws on our books."
11929,-3,-1,"But I want to repeat, if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in Texas, we're going to go after all crime."
11941,-3,-1,But I think marriage is a sacred institution.
11945,-3,-1,But I feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman.
11947,-3,0,"I agree with that, and I did support that law."
11948,-3,-1,"But I think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions, and I basically agree with Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman."
11949,-3,-1,And I think the three of us have one view and the Governor has another view.
11951,-3,-1,I'm not sure what kind of view he's describing to me.
11952,-3,-1,"I can just tell you, I'm a person who respects other people."
11955,-3,-1,But I will be a tolerant person.
11960,-3,-1,"I don't think they ought to have special rights, but I think they ought to have the same rights."
11965,-3,1,"Now, I wonder if the -- it's been blocked by the opponents in the majority in the Congress."
11971,-3,-1,"I mean, he can throw out all kinds -- I don't know the particulars of this law."
11973,-3,-1,"As a matter of fact, I would like to take the issue a little further."
11974,-3,-1,"I don't really think it's any of my -- you know, any of my concerns what -- how you conduct your sex life."
11976,-3,-1,And I think that's the way it ought to be.
11980,-3,-1,"That doesn't mean we shouldn't fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people, which I will do as the President of the United States."
11988,-3,-1,I think these assault weapons are a problem.
11993,-3,-1,I think we ought to restore the three-day waiting period under the Brady Law.
11994,-3,-1,I think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively.
11995,-3,1,Some of the restrictions that have been placed by the Congress in the last couple of years.
11996,-3,-1,I think -- in the last few years I think have been unfortunate.
11998,-3,-1,Have a gun-free zone around every school in this country.
12004,-3,-1,"If you're going to sell a gun illegally, you need to be arrested."
12007,-3,1,Programs like Project Exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns.
12008,-3,-1,And we haven't done a very good job of that at the federal level recently.
12018,-3,-1,I think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21.
12022,-3,-1,"The criminal is not going to show up and say hey, give me my I.D."
12044,-3,-1,I do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now.
12050,-3,-1,"Well, I'm not for photo licensing."
12051,-3,-1,Let me say something about Columbine.
12058,-3,-1,But Columbine spoke to a larger issue.
12059,-3,-1,It's really a matter of culture.
12062,-3,-1,"So gun laws are important, no question about it, but so is loving children, and character education classes, and faith-based programs being a part of after-school programs."
12064,-3,-1,So there's a -- this is a society that -- of ours that's got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong.
12067,-3,-1,But there's a larger law.
12068,-3,-1,Love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself.
12070,-3,-1,I also believe in the Golden Rule.
12076,-3,-1,"And if I'm elected president, I will do something about that."
12077,-3,-1,But I think that we -- I think we have to start with better parenting.
12078,-3,-1,But I don't think that we can ignore the role played by guns.
12081,-3,-1,"And I think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the United States compared to any other country in the world, it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen, we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands."
12089,-3,-1,"We say, if you get caught carrying a gun, you're automatically detained."
12099,-3,-1,It's to make health care affordable and available this way.
12104,-3,-1,"For those what I think we need to do is to develop an investment-type vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest, like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity."
12105,-3,-1,"In other words, you say to a youngster, it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness, but for the working folks that do want to have health care that can't afford it, a couple of things we need to do."
12106,-3,-1,"One, we need more community health centers."
12109,-3,-1,Secondly -- and they're good.
12111,-3,1,"Secondly, that you get a $2,000 rebate from the government if you're a family of $30,000 or less -- it scales down as you get higher -- that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets."
12114,-3,1,"And to make health care more affordable, allow business associations like the National Federal of Independent Business or the Chamber of Commerce or the National Restaurant Association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down."
12123,-3,1,"And the budget plan that I've put out, according to the ""Los Angeles Times"" again, the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the GDP, will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years."
12128,-3,-1,"Now, I know that we have some disagreements on this."
12135,-3,-1,I think it ought to be a top priority.
12142,-3,1,"Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President."
12148,-3,-1,"You can quote all the numbers you want, but I'm telling you we care about our people in Texas."
12154,-3,1,"He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program."
12155,-3,-1,There's -- you don't have to take my word for this.
12158,-3,1,"600,000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600,000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldn't sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up."
12165,-3,-1,"Now, it's not the most efficient way to get people health care."
12166,-3,1,"But I want to remind you, the number of uninsured in America during their watch has increased."
12172,-3,1,"And I was able to do so with a lot of Democrat votes, nearly 50% of the Hispanic vote, about 27% of the African-American vote, because people know I'm a conservative person and a compassionate person."
12179,-3,-1,But it's not a statement about his heart.
12180,-3,0,I don't claim to know his heart.
12181,-3,-1,I think he's a good person.
12182,-3,-1,I make no allegations about that.
12184,-3,-1,I know enough about your story to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person.
12185,-3,-1,But I think it's about his priorities.
12189,-3,1,"Because by his own budget numbers, his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined."
12190,-3,-1,According to his own numbers.
12191,-3,-1,"So it's not a question of his heart, as far as I know."
12195,-3,-1,"First of all, that's simply not true what he just said, of course."
12203,-3,-1,We just have a different point of view.
12204,-3,-1,It's a totally different point of view.
12205,-3,1,He believes only the right people ought to get tax relief.
12206,-3,-1,I believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief.
12209,-3,-1,I can't emphasize to you how much.
12210,-3,1,I signed a bill that puts CHIPS in place.
12211,-3,1,The bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session.
12213,-3,1,"We're doing it faster than any other state our size, comparable state."
12215,-3,-1,And our state cares a lot about our children.
12216,-3,-1,My priority is going to be the health of our citizens.
12221,-3,-1,"And my case to the American people is, if you're happy with inactivity, stay with the horse."
12222,-3,0,The horse is up here now.
12230,-3,1,There was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years.
12236,-3,-1,They're moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fast-growing world market.
12239,-3,-1,I think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated.
12240,-3,-1,We have to be bold.
12241,-3,-1,We have to provide leadership.
12251,-3,1,We are a big industrial state.
12252,-3,1,We reduced our industrial waste by 11%.
12254,-3,1,Our water is cleaner now.
12267,-3,1,"Gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to -- we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that there's mandatory -- that the plants must conform to clean air standards, the grandfathered plants, that's what we did in Texas."
12270,-3,-1,"In other words, there are practical things we can do."
12271,-3,1,But it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks.
12272,-3,-1,"If you own the land, every day is Earth Day."
12279,-3,-1,I am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies.
12287,-3,-1,Let me give you an example.
12293,-3,-1,"Well, I don't believe in command and control out of Washington, D.C."
12294,-3,-1,"I believe Washington ought to set standards, but again I think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels and I think we ought to work with people at the local levels."
12295,-3,-1,"And by the way, I just want to make sure -- I can't let him just say something and not correct it."
12296,-3,1,"The electric decontrol bill that I fought for and signed in Texas has mandatory emission standards, Mr. Vice President."
12299,-3,-1,"I think, for example, take -- when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials, I thought that was --"
12303,-3,-1,That's not the way I would have done it.
12310,-3,-1,I think it's an issue that we need to take very seriously.
12311,-3,-1,But I don't think we know the solution to global warming yet.
12312,-3,-1,And I don't think we've got all the facts before we make decisions.
12315,-3,1,China and India were exempted from that treaty.
12322,-3,0,I'm not for command and control techniques either.
12326,-3,1,"It's pollution, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals that are even more potent, but in smaller quantities, that cause this."
12330,-3,-1,I want to be able to tell my grandson when I'm in my later years that I didn't turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm.
12346,-3,0,"That's an interruption, by the way."
12354,-3,-1,Of course they care about them.
12355,-3,-1,"Oh, you mean the rules."
12361,-3,-1,"And before we react, I think it's best to have the full accounting, full understanding of what's taking place."
12363,-1,-1,We may have different approaches.
12364,-3,-1,We may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks.
12366,-3,0,"And I remember you gave a very good answer to New Hampshire about the White Mountains, about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place."
12378,-3,-1,I think credibility is important.
12382,-3,1,"I read a report, or a memo, from somebody in his 1988 campaign -- I forgot the fellow's name -- warning then Senator Gore to be careful about exaggerating claims."
12384,-3,0,I mention the last debate --
12391,-3,-1,I found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package.
12392,-3,-1,I thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers.
12393,-3,-1,But the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue.
12394,-3,-1,And I am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what I think are exaggerations.
12395,-3,1,"Exaggerations like, for example, only 5% of seniors receive benefits under my Medicare reform package."
12396,-3,0,"That's what he said the other day, and that's simply not the case."
12398,-3,-1,That's what debates are about and that's what campaigns are about.
12402,-3,-1,One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make.
12406,-3,-1,And we need to do something about that.
12414,-3,1,"That's going to be up to the people, isn't it?"
12419,-3,-1,I think they may be using the man's own words.
12421,-3,-1,I don't believe I've used those words.
12432,-3,-1,"The -- I haven't seen that, in my commercials?"
12435,-3,1,"I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy."
12436,-3,-1,I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person.
12445,-3,-1,"I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students."
12446,-3,-1,"I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also."
12453,-3,1,"I've a plan in my budget to recruit 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools."
12457,-3,1,"If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you can't do education."
12463,-3,-1,"Mr. Vice President, thank you very much, and I would like to thank the folks here at Wake Forest, and I want to thank you all for listening."
12467,-3,-1,I would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future.
12469,-3,-1,No child should be left behind in America.
12471,-3,-1,I worry about morale in today's military.
12473,-3,-1,"It is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military, pay our men and women more, make sure they're housed better and have a focused mission for our military."
12474,-3,-1,"Once and for all, I want to do something about Medicare."
12479,-3,-1,"But younger workers, in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow, younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money."
12480,-3,-1,"And finally, I do believe in tax relief."
12481,-3,-1,I believe we can set our priorities.
12482,-3,-1,"I don't believe, like the vice president does, in huge government."
12483,-3,-1,I believe in limited government.
12485,-3,-1,"I want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in America, because I think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can."
12513,-3,0,I have traveled to forty-eight of the fifty states and in my travels I have learned what the people of the United States are thinking about.
12515,-3,-1,"And that issue, very simply stated, is this: how can we keep the peace - keep it without surrender?"
12516,-3,-1,How can we extend freedom - extend it without war?
12517,-3,-1,"Now in determining how we deal with this issue, we must find the answer to a very important but simple question: who threatens the peace?"
12518,-3,-1,Who threatens freedom in the world?
12519,-3,-1,There is only one threat to peace and one threat to freedom - that that is presented by the international Communist movement.
12520,-3,-1,"And therefore if we are to have peace, we must know how to deal with the Communists and their leaders."
12525,-3,1,"In the seven years before this Administration came into power in Washington, we found that six hundred million people went behind the Iron Curtain."
12528,-3,1,"We ended the Korean War; by strong, firm leadership we have kept out of other wars; and we have avoided surrender of principle or territory at the conference table."
12530,-3,-1,I think there're several reasons.
12531,-3,-1,"In the first place, they made a fatal error in misjudging the Communists; in trying to apply to them the same rules of conduct that you would apply to the leaders of the free world."
12538,-3,-1,"But we have never been willing to do anything that, in effect, surrendered freedom any place in the world."
12541,-3,-1,Why did the President feel this was wrong and why was the President right and his critics wrong?
12543,-3,-1,It encourages them to begin a war.
12544,-3,-1,"And so I say that the record shows that we know how to keep the peace, to keep it without surrender."
12545,-3,-1,Let us move now to the future.
12546,-3,-1,"It is not enough to stand on this record because we are dealing with the most ruthless, fanatical... leaders that the world has ever seen."
12547,-3,-1,"That is why I say that in this period of the sixties, America must move forward in every area."
12548,-3,1,"First of all, although we are today, as Senator Kennedy has admitted, the strongest nation in the world militarily, we must increase our strength, increase it so that we will always have enough strength that regardless of what our potential opponents have - if the should launch a surprise attack - we will be able to destroy their war-making capability."
12549,-3,-1,"They must know, in other words, that it is national suicide if they begin anything."
12550,-3,-1,We need this kind of strength because we're the guardians of the peace.
12551,-3,-1,"In addition to military strength, we need to see that the economy of this country continues to grow."
12553,-3,-1,It can and will grow even more in the next four.
12554,-3,-1,And the reason that it must grow even more is because we have things to do at home and also because we're in a race for survival - a race in which it isn't enough to be ahead; it isn't enough simply to be complacent.
12555,-3,-1,We have to move ahead in order to stay ahead.
12559,-3,-1,Again we turn to the past.
12560,-3,-1,"Firmness but no belligerence, and by no belligerence I mean that we do not answer insult by insult."
12561,-3,-1,"When you are proud and confident of your strength, you do not get down to the level of Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues."
12562,-3,-1,And that example that President Eisenhower has set we will continue to follow.
12563,-3,-1,But all this by itself is not enough.
12565,-3,-1,We must have a great goal.
12566,-3,-1,"And that is: not just to keep freedom for ourselves but to extend it to all the world, to extend it to all the world because that is America's destiny."
12567,-3,-1,To extend it to all the world because the Communist aim is not to hold their own but to extend Communism.
12569,-3,-1,"And so I say that we believe that our policies of military strength, of economic strength, of diplomatic firmness first will keep the peace and keep it without surrender."
12570,-3,-1,"We also believe that in the great field of ideals that we can lead America to the victory for freedom - victory in the newly developing countries, victory also in the captive countries - provided we have faith in ourselves and faith in our principles."
12572,-3,-1,"Mr. Howe, Mr. Vice President."
12573,-3,-1,First uh - let me again try to correct the record on the matter of Quemoy and Matsu.
12575,-3,1,I have sustained it since then.
12577,-3,1,"Mr. Nixon earlier indicated that he would defend Quemoy and Matsu even if the attack on these islands, two miles off the coast of China, were not part of a general attack an Formosa and the Pescadores."
12584,-3,-1,The question is: are we moving in the direction of peace and security?
12585,-3,-1,Is our relative strength growing?
12587,-3,-1,I don't believe it is.
12589,-3,-1,"And I say that not as the Democratic standard-bearer, but as a citizen of the United States who is concerned about the United States."
12590,-3,0,"I look at Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States."
12592,-3,0,I talked to the American Ambassador there.
12595,-3,-1,Our d- security depends upon Latin America.
12598,-3,-1,It was rather a vague statement that they finally made.
12600,-3,1,"Do you know we don't have a single program sponsored by our government to Cuba - to tell them our story, to tell them that we are their friends, that we want them to be free again?"
12601,-3,-1,Africa is now the emerging area of the world.
12602,-3,1,It contains twenty-five percent of all the members of the General Assembly.
12604,-3,1,"In the Africa south of the Sahara, which is the major new section, we have less students from all of Africa in that area studying under government auspices today than from the country of Thailand."
12605,-3,-1,If there's one thing Africa needs it's technical assistance.
12607,-3,1,"We relied in the Middle East on the Baghdad Pact, and yet when the Iraqi Government was changed, the Baghdad Pact broke down."
12611,-3,-1,"Which system, Communism or freedom, will triumph in the next five or ten years?"
12612,-3,-1,"That's what should concern us, not the history of ten, or fifteen, or twenty years ago."
12615,-3,-1,"By 1965 or 1970, will there be other Cubas in Latin America?"
12616,-3,1,"Will Guinea and Ghana, which have now voted with the Communists frequently as newly independent countries of Africa - will there be others?"
12617,-3,-1,Will the Congo go Communist?
12621,-3,-1,Is India going to win the economic struggle or is China going to win it?
12622,-3,-1,Who will dominate Asia in the next five or ten years?
12627,-3,-1,Is our strength and prestige rising?
12628,-3,-1,Do people want to be identified with us?
12629,-3,-1,Do they want to follow United States leadership?
12630,-3,-1,"I don't think they do, enough."
12631,-3,-1,And that's what concerns me.
12633,-3,1,"On the question of admission of Red China, only two countries in all of Africa voted with us - Liberia and the Union of South Africa."
12634,-3,1,The rest either abstained or voted against us.
12635,-3,1,More countries in Asia voted against us on that question than voted with us.
12636,-3,-1,"I believe that this struggle is going to go on, and it may be well decided in the next decade."
12637,-3,0,I have seen Cuba go to the Communists.
12641,-3,1,There isn't a single American diplomatic representative in any of those six.
12642,-3,1,"When Guinea became independent, the Soviet Ambassador showed up that very day."
12644,-3,-1,I believe that the world is changing fast.
12645,-3,-1,"And I don't think this Administration has shown the foresight, has shown the knowledge, has been identified with the great fight which these people are waging to be free, to get a better standard of living, to live better."
12646,-3,1,The average income in some of those countries is twenty-five dollars a year.
12648,-3,-1,"And we've been in - on the whole, uninterested."
12653,-3,1,"They made a breakthrough in missiles, and by nineteen sixty-one, two, and three, they will be outnumbering us in missiles."
12654,-3,-1,I'm not as confident as he is that we will be the strongest military power by 1963.
12655,-3,-1,He talks about economic growth as a great indicator of freedom.
12657,-3,-1,"What we do in this country, the kind of society that we build, that will tell whether freedom will be sustained around the world."
12663,-3,-1,"The point of all this is, this is a struggle in which we're engaged."
12667,-3,-1,We want to be stronger.
12668,-3,-1,We want freedom to gain.
12669,-3,-1,But I don't believe in these changing and revolutionary times this Administration has known that the world is changing - has identified itself with that change.
12671,-3,-1,I think we have to revita1ize our society.
12672,-3,-1,"I think we have to demonstrate to the people of the world that we're determined in this free country of ours to be first - not first if, and not first but, and not first when - but first."
12673,-3,-1,"And when we are strong and when we are first, then freedom gains; then the prospects for peace increase; then the prospects for our society gain."
12682,-3,-1,Now let's just see what this means.
12683,-3,1,"We have five treaties with Latin America, including the one setting up the Organization of American States in Bogota in 1948, in which we have agreed not to intervene in the internal affairs of any other American country - and they as well have agreed to do likewise."
12685,-3,-1,"Now I don't know what Senator Kennedy suggests when he says that we should help those who oppose the Castro regime, both in Cuba and without."
12686,-3,-1,"But I do know this: that if we were to follow that recommendation, that we would lose all of our friends in Latin America, we would probably be condemned in the United Nations, and we would not accomplish our objective."
12688,-3,-1,"It would be an open invitation for Mr. Khrushchev to come in, to come into Latin America and to engage us in what would be a civil war, and possibly even worse than that."
12691,-3,-1,"Well, we can do what we did with Guatemala."
12695,-3,1,We are quarantining Mr. Castro today.
12697,-3,-1,We are cutting off the significant items that the Cuban regime needs in order to survive.
12699,-3,-1,"But for us to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested would bring results which I know he would not want, and certainly which the American people would not want."
12700,-3,-1,Mr. Nixon uh - shows himself i- misinformed.
12703,-3,-1,"Number two, I believe that if any economic sanctions against Latin America are going to be successful they have to be multilateral."
12704,-3,-1,They have to include the other countries of Latin America.
12705,-3,-1,"The very minute effect of the action which has been taken this week on Cuba's economy - I believe Castro can replace those markets very easily through Latin America, through Europe, and through Eastern Europe."
12707,-3,-1,"That's the only way you can bring real economic pressure on the Castro regime - and also the countries of Western Europe, Canada, Japan and the others."
12708,-3,-1,"Number three, Castro is only the beginning of our difficulties throughout Latin America."
12709,-3,-1,"The big struggle will be to prevent the influence of Castro spreading to other countries - Mexico, Panama, Bolivia, Colombia."
12710,-3,-1,"We're going to have to try to provide closer ties, to associate ourselves with the great desire of these people for a better life if we're going to prevent Castro's influence from spreading throughout all of Latin America."
12711,-3,-1,His influence is strong enough today to prevent us from joi- getting the other countries of Latin America to join with us in economic quarantine.
12712,-3,1,His influence is growing - mostly because this Administration has ignored Latin America.
12720,-3,-1,"Mr. Edwards, I don't think it's a wise idea for presidential candidates to appoint the members of his cabinet prospectively, or to suggest four people - indicate that one of them surely will be appointed."
12721,-3,-1,This is a decision that the president of the United States must make.
12722,-3,1,The last candidate who indicated that he knew who his cabinet was going to be was Mr. Dewey in 1948.
12724,-3,-1,There are a good many able men who could be secretary of state.
12726,-3,-1,"I think that judgment could be made after election, if I'm successful."
12727,-3,-1,"The people have to make a choice between Mr. Nixon and myself, between the Republican party and the Democratic party, between our approach to the problems which now disturb us as a nation and disturb us as a world power."
12728,-3,0,"The president bears the constitutional responsibility, not the secretary of state, for the conduct of foreign affairs."
12729,-3,-1,Some presidents have been strong in foreign policy; others have relied heavily on the secretary of state.
12730,-3,0,"I've been a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; I run for the presidency with full knowledge that his great responsibility, really, given to him by the Constitution and by the force of events, is in the field of foreign affairs."
12731,-3,-1,I'm asking the people's support as president.
12732,-3,-1,We will select the best man we can get.
12735,-3,-1,"Well Mr. Edwards, as you probably know, I have consistently answered all questions with regard to who will be in the next cabinet by saying that that is the responsibility of the next president, and it would be inappropriate to make any decisions on that or to announce any prior to the time that I had the right to do so."
12740,-3,0,"We have moved in Latin America very effectively, and I'd also like to point this out: Senator Kennedy complains very appropriately about our inadequate ra- radio broadcasts for Latin America."
12741,-3,1,Let me point out again that his Congress - the Democratic Congress - has cut eighty million dollars off of the Voice of America appropriations.
12742,-3,-1,"Now, he has to get a better job out of his Congress if he's going to get us the money that we need to conduct the foreign affairs of this country in Latin America or any place else."
12747,-3,-1,"Mr. Cronkite, I naturally am aware of it, because I, of course, pay attention to everything Senator Kennedy says, as well as Senator Fulbright."
12748,-3,-1,"Now, in this connection I want to point out that the facts simply aren't as stated."
12751,-3,-1,"Third, I would say this with regard to this report, with regard to Gallup Polls of prestige abroad and everything else that we've been hearing about ""what about American prestige abroad"": America's prestige abroad will be just as high as the spokesmen for America allow it to be."
12752,-3,1,"Now, when we have a presidential candidate, for example - Senator Kennedy - stating over and over again that the United States is second in space and the fact of the matter is that the space score today is twenty-eight to eight - we've had twenty-eight successful shots, they've had eight; when he states that we're second in education, and I have seen Soviet education and I've seen ours, and we're not; that we're second in science because they may be ahead in one area or another, when overall we're way ahead of the Soviet Union and all other countries in science; when he says as he did in January of this year that we have the worst slums, that we have the most crowded schools; when he says that seventeen million people go to bed hungry every night; when he makes statements like this, what does this do to American prestige?"
12753,-3,-1,"Well, it can only have the effect certainly of reducing it."
12754,-3,-1,Well let me make one thing clear.
12757,-3,-1,And for that reason he has contributed to any lack of prestige.
12758,-3,-1,"Finally, let me say this: as far as prestige is concerned, the first place it would show up would be in the United Nations."
12760,-3,-1,Let's look at the vote on Hungary.
12761,-3,1,There we got more votes for condemning Hungary and looking into that situation than we got the last year.
12762,-3,-1,Let's look at the reaction eh - reaction to Khrushchev and Eisenhower at the last U.N. session.
12763,-3,-1,Did Khrushchev gain because he took his shoe off and pounded the table and shouted and insulted?
12766,-3,-1,"America gained by continuing the dignity, the decency that has characterized us and it's that that keeps the prestige of America up, not running down America the way Senator Kennedy has been running her down."
12768,-3,-1,I really don't need uh - Mr. Nixon to tell me about what my responsibilities are as a citizen.
12769,-3,0,I've served this country for fourteen years in the Congress and before that in the service.
12770,-3,-1,"I've just as high a devotion, just as high an opinion."
12772,-3,-1,Now I didn't make most of the statements that you said I made.
12773,-3,-1,The s- I believe the Soviet Union is first in outer space.
12774,-3,0,"We have - may have made more shots but the size of their rocket thrust and all the rest - you yourself said to Khrushchev, ""You may be ahead of us in rocket thrust but we're ahead of you in color television"" in your famous discussion in the kitchen."
12775,-3,-1,I think that color television is not as important as rocket thrust.
12777,-3,-1,I said we had too many slums.
12781,-3,-1,"And fourth, I believe that the polls and other studies and votes in the United Nations and anyone reading the paper and any citizen of the United States must come to the conclusion that the United States no longer carries the same image of a vital society on the move with its brightest days ahead as it carried a decade or two decades ago."
12782,-3,-1,"Part of that is because we've stood still here at home, because we haven't met our problems in the United States, because we haven't had a moving economy."
12794,-3,-1,So one more effort should be made.
12795,-3,-1,I don't think that even if that effort fails that it will be necessary to carry on tests in the atmosphere which pollute the atmosphere.
12798,-3,-1,"If we fail, it's been a great serious failure for everyone - for the human race."
12799,-3,-1,I hope we can succeed.
12800,-3,-1,"But then if we fail responsibility will be clearly on the Russians and then we'll have to meet our responsibilities to the security of the United States, and there may have to be testing underground."
12801,-3,-1,I think the Atomic Energy Committee is prepared for it.
12802,-3,-1,There may be testing in outer space.
12803,-3,-1,I hope it will not be necessary for any power to resume uh - testing in the atmosphere.
12805,-3,-1,The kind of tests which you can't detect are underground or in - in uh - perhaps in outer space.
12806,-3,-1,So that I'm hopeful we can try once more.
12807,-3,-1,If we fail then we must meet our responsibilities to ourselves.
12808,-3,-1,But I'm most concerned about the whole problem of the spread of atomic weapons.
12810,-3,-1,"War has been the constant companion of mankind, so to have these weapons disseminated around the world, I believe means that we're going to move through a period of hazard in the next few years."
12811,-3,-1,We ought to make one last effort.
12814,-3,1,"I would say first of all that we must have in mind the fact that we have been negotiating to get tests inspected and uh - to get an agreement for many, many months."
12816,-3,-1,I've reached the conclusion that the Soviet Union is actually filibustering.
12818,-3,-1,"I don't think we can wait until the next president is inaugurated and then uh - select a new team and then all the months of negotiating that will take place before we reach a decision, I think that immediately after this election we should set a timetable - the next president, working with the present President, President Eisenhower - a timetable to break the Soviet filibuster."
12819,-3,-1,There should be no tests in the atmosphere; that rules out any fall-out.
12820,-3,-1,"But as far as underground tests for developing peaceful uses of atomic energy, we should not allow this Soviet filibuster to continue."
12821,-3,-1,I think it's time for them to fish or cut bait.
12822,-3,-1,"I think that the next president immediately after his election should sit down with the President, work out a timetable, and - get a decision on this before January of next year."
12828,-3,-1,"Uh - First of all, we have to have adequate preparation for a summit conference."
12830,-3,-1,"By adequate preparation I mean that at that level we must prepare an agenda, an agenda agreed upon with the approval of the heads of state involved."
12831,-3,-1,Now this agenda should delineate those issues on which there is a possibility of some agreement or negotiation.
12833,-3,-1,"Now this may seem like a rigid, inflexible position."
12834,-3,-1,But let's look at the other side of the coin.
12835,-3,-1,"If we build up the hopes of the world by having a summit conference that is not adequately prepared, and then, if Mr. Khrushchev finds some excuse for breaking it up - as he did this one - because he isn't going to get his way - we'd set back the cause of peace."
12836,-3,-1,We do not help it.
12838,-3,-1,"I think we have to make a greater effort than we have been making at the secretary of state level, at the ambassadorial level, to work out the differences that we have."
12839,-3,-1,"And so far as the summit conference is concerned, it should only be entered in upon, it should only be agreed upon, if the negotiations have reached the point that we have some reasonable assurance that something is going to come out of it, other than some phony spirit - a spirit of Geneva, or Camp David, or whatever it is."
12840,-3,-1,"When I say ""phony spirit,"" I mean phony, not because the spirit is not good on our side, but because the Soviet Union simply doesn't intend to carry out what they say."
12841,-3,-1,"Now, these are the conditions that I can lay out."
12842,-3,-1,"I cannot be more precise than that, because until we see what Mr. Khrushchev does and what he says uh - we cannot indicate what our plans will be."
12847,-3,1,"The Soviet Union refused to agree to that, and we went to the summit and it was disastrous."
12848,-3,-1,"I believe we should not go to the summit until there is some reason to believe that a meeting of minds can be obtained on either Berlin, outer space, or general disarmament - including nuclear testing."
12849,-3,-1,"In addition, I believe the next president in January and February should go to work in building the strength of the United States."
12850,-3,-1,The Soviet Union does understand strength.
12851,-3,0,"We arm to parley, Winston Churchill said ten years ago."
12852,-3,-1,"If we are strong, particularly as we face a crisis over Berlin - which we may in the spring, or in the winter - it's important that we maintain our determination here; that we indicate that we're building our strength; that we are determined to protect our position; that we're determined to protect our commitment."
12853,-3,-1,And then I believe we should indicate our desire to live at peace with the world.
12854,-3,-1,"But until we're strong here, until we're moving here, I believe a summit could not be successful."
12855,-3,-1,"I hope that before we do meet, there will be preliminary agreements on those four questions, or at least two of them, or even one of them, which would warrant such a meeting."
12856,-3,-1,"I think if we had stuck by that position last winter, we would have been in a better position in May."
12861,-3,-1,"One of the areas, and of course the most vulnerable area is - I have felt, has been Eastern Europe."
12866,-3,1,"We received the support first of the Administration and then not, and we were defeated by one vote in the Senate."
12868,-3,-1,I would say Eastern Europe is the area of vulnerability of the uh - s- of the Soviet Union.
12869,-3,-1,"Secondly, the relations between Russia and China."
12871,-3,-1,"No one can say what that course of action will be, but I think the next president of the United States should watch it carefully."
12872,-3,-1,"If those two powers should split, it could have great effects throughout the entire world."
12873,-3,-1,"Thirdly, I believe that India represents a great area for affirmative action by the free world."
12877,-3,-1,"But if India does not succeed - with her four hundred and fifty million people, if she can't make freedom work - then people around the world are going to determine - particularly in the underdeveloped world - that the only way that they can develop their resources is through the Communist system."
12878,-3,-1,"Fourth, let me say that in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, the great force on our side is the desire of people to be free."
12879,-3,-1,This has expressed itself in the revolts in Eastern Europe.
12880,-3,-1,It's expressed itself in the desire of the people of Africa to be independent of Western Europe.
12882,-3,-1,And my judgment is that they don't want to give their freedom up to become Communists.
12884,-3,-1,"And I believe if we identify ourselves with that force, if we identify ourselves with it as Lincoln, as Wilson did, as Franklin Roosevelt did, if we become known as the friend of freedom, sustaining freedom, helping freedom, helping these people in the fight against poverty and ignorance and disease, helping them build their lives, I believe in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, eventually in the Eastern Europe and the Middle East, certainly in Western Europe, we can strengthen freedom."
12886,-3,-1,We can put the Communists on the defensive.
12888,-3,0,"First, with regard to Poland, when I talked to Mr. Gomulka, the present leader of Poland, for six hours in Warsaw last year, I learned something about their problems and particularly his."
12890,-3,1,"And yet let's just see what we've done for Poland, A half a billion dollars worth of aid has gone to Poland, primarily economic, primarily to go to the people of Poland."
12891,-3,-1,This should continue and it can be stepped up to give them hope and to keep alive the hope for freedom that I can testify they have so deeply within them.
12892,-3,-1,In addition we can have more exchange with Poland or with any other of the Iron Curtain countries which show some desire to take a different path than the path that has been taken by the ones that are complete satellites of the Soviet Union.
12893,-3,-1,"Now as far as the balance of the world is concerned, I of course don't have as much time as Senator Kennedy had."
12894,-3,-1,I would just like to s- add this one point.
12895,-3,-1,"If we are going to have the initiative in the world, we must remember that the people of Africa and Asia and Latin America don't want to be pawns simply in a struggle between two great powers - the Soviet Union and the United States."
12897,-3,-1,"If we can get that across to the people of these countries, in this decade of the sixties, the struggle for freedom will be won."
12903,-3,-1,I would say that the issue will stay with us as a campaign issue just as long as Senator Kennedy persists in what I think is a fundamental error.
12904,-3,1,He says he supports the President's position.
12905,-3,1,He says that he voted for the resolution.
12906,-3,1,Well just let me point this out; he voted for the resolution in 1955 which gave the president the power to use the forces of the United States to defend Formosa and the offshore islands.
12907,-3,1,"But he also voted then for an amendment - which was lost, fortunately - an amendment which would have drawn a line and left out those islands and denied the p- right to the president to defend those islands if he thought that it was an attack on Formosa."
12908,-3,1,"He repeated that error in 1959, in the speech that he made."
12909,-3,0,He repeated it again in a television debate that we had.
12910,-3,-1,"Now, my point is this: Senator Kennedy has got to be consistent here."
12912,-3,-1,"Now if the Senator in his answer to this question will say ""I now will depart, or retract my previous views; I think I was wrong in I 955; I think I was wrong in 1959; and I think I was wrong in our television debate to say that we should draw a line leaving out Quemoy and Matsu - draw a line in effect abandoning these islands to the Communists;"" then this will be right out of the campaign because there will be no issue between us."
12913,-3,-1,I support the President's position.
12915,-3,-1,"I have opposed drawing a line because I know that the moment you draw a line, that is an encouragement for the Communists to attack - to step up their blackmail and to force you into the war that none of us want."
12916,-3,-1,And so I would hope that Senator Kennedy in his answer today would clear it up.
12917,-3,-1,"It isn't enough for him to say ""I support the President's position, that I voted for the resolution."""
12920,-3,-1,It's very simple for him to clear it up.
12924,-3,-1,"Well, Mr. Nixon, to go back to 1955."
12926,-3,1,"Then the President sent a mission, composed of Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to persuade Chiang Kai-shek in the spring of fifty-five to withdraw from the two islands, because they were exposed."
12927,-3,1,The President was unsuccessful; Chiang Kai-shek would not withdraw.
12928,-3,1,"I refer to the fact that in 1958, as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I'm very familiar with the position that the United States took in negotiating with the Chinese Communists on these two islands."
12932,-3,-1,Chiang Kai-shek will not withdraw.
12938,-3,1,"The first position you took, when this matter first came up, was that we should draw the line and commit ourselves, as a matter of principle, to defend these islands."
12939,-3,-1,Not as part of the defense of Formosa and the Pescadores.
12940,-3,1,You showed no recognition of the Administration program to try to persuade Chiang Kai-shek for the last five years to withdraw from the islands.
12941,-3,1,And I challenge you tonight to deny that the Administration has sent at least several missions to persuade Chiang Kai-shek's withdrawal from these islands.
12950,-3,-1,"If I lose this election, I will continue in the Senate to try to build a stronger country."
12951,-3,-1,"But I run because I believe this year the United States has a great opportunity to make a move forward, to make a determination here at home and around the world, that it's going to reestablish itself as a vigorous society."
12952,-3,-1,"My judgment is that the Republican party has stood still here in the United States, and it's also stood still around the world."
12953,-3,1,Uh - We're using about fifty percent of our steel capacity today.
12956,-3,-1,We're not moving ahead in education the way we should.
12958,-3,-1,"If we stand still here, if we appoint people to ambassadorships and positions in Washington who have a status quo outlook, who don't recognize that this is a revolutionary time, then the United States does not maintain its influence."
12960,-3,-1,"I believe it incumbent upon the next president of the United States to get this country moving again, to get our economy moving ahead, to set before the American people its goals, its unfinished business."
12961,-3,-1,"And then throughout the world appoint the best people we can get, ambassadors who can speak the language - no mere - not merely people who made a political contribution but who can speak the language."
12962,-3,-1,Bring students here; let them see what kind of a country we have.
12964,-3,-1,"If that were true, why didn't we identify ourselves with the people of Africa?"
12965,-3,-1,Why didn't we bring students over here?
12969,-3,1,"It opposed all of the programs of President Roosevelt and others - the minimum wage and for housing and economic growth and development of our natural resources, the Tennessee Valley and all the rest."
12970,-3,-1,"And I believe that if we can get a party which believes in movement, which believes in going ahead, then we can reestablish our position in the world - strong defense, strong in economic growth, justice for our people, co- guarantee of constitutional rights, so that people will believe that we practice what we preach, and then around the world, particularly to try to reestablish the atmosphere which existed in Latin America at the time of Franklin Roosevelt."
12972,-3,-1,I believe it my responsibility as the leader of the Democratic party in 1960 to try to warn the American people that in this crucial time we can no longer afford to stand still.
12973,-3,-1,We can no longer afford to be second best.
12974,-3,-1,"I want people all over the world to look to the United States again, to feel that we're on the move, to feel that our high noon is in the future."
12975,-3,-1,"I want Mr. Khrushchev to know that a new generation of Americans who fought in Europe and Italy and the Pacific for freedom in World War II have now taken over in the United States, and that they're going to put this country back to work again."
12976,-3,-1,I don't believe that there is anything this country cannot do.
12977,-3,-1,"I don't believe there's any burden, or any responsibility, that any American would not assume to protect his country, to protect our security, to advance the cause of freedom."
12978,-3,-1,And I believe it incumbent upon us now to do that.
12980,-3,-1,I believe in 1960 and sixty-one and two and three we have a rendezvous with destiny.
12981,-3,-1,"And I believe it incumbent upon us to be the defenders of the United States and the defenders of freedom; and to do that, we must give this country leadership and we must get America moving again."
12983,-3,0,"Senator Kennedy has said tonight again what he has said several times in the course of this - these debates and in the campaign, that American is standing still."
12984,-3,-1,America is not standing still.
12986,-3,-1,"And let's set the record straight right now by looking at the record, as Al Smith used to say."
12988,-3,1,We built more houses in the last seven years than in any Administration and thirty percent more than in the previous Administration.
12989,-3,1,We talk about schools - three times as many classrooms built in the past Administration - and Eisenhower - than under the Truman Administration.
12991,-3,1,More progress in the past eight years than in the whole eighty years before.
12993,-3,1,We find four times as many projects undertaken and completed in this Administration than in the previous one.
12997,-3,-1,"Now the second point we have to understand is this, however."
12999,-3,-1,But America cannot stand pat.
13000,-3,-1,"We can't stand pat for the reason that we're in a race, as I've indicated."
13004,-3,-1,It means keeping America even stronger militarily than she is.
13005,-3,-1,It means seeing that our economy moves forward even faster than it has.
13006,-3,-1,It means making more progress in civil rights than we have so that we can be a splendid example for all the world to see - a democracy in action at its best.
13007,-3,-1,"Now, looking at the other parts of the world - South America - talking about our record and the previous one."
13008,-3,-1,"We had a good neighbor policy, yes."
13010,-3,-1,But let's look at it.
13011,-3,1,There were eleven dictators when we came into power in 1953 in Latin America.
13012,-3,1,There are only three left.
13014,-3,1,Twenty new countries in Africa during the course of this Administration.
13015,-3,1,Not one of them selected a Communist government.
13018,-3,-1,Am I trying to indicate that we have no problems in Africa or Latin America or Asia?
13020,-3,-1,"What I am trying to indicate is that the tide of history's on our side, and that we can keep it on our side, because we're on the right side."
13021,-3,-1,We're on the side of freedom.
13024,-3,1,"Because we are first in the world in space, as I've indicated; we are first in science; we are first in education, and we're going to move even further ahead with the kind of leadership that we can provide in these years ahead."
13025,-3,-1,One other point I would make: what could you do?
13027,-3,-1,And in the years to come it will be written that one or the other of us was elected and that he was or was not a great president.
13028,-3,-1,"What will determine whether Senator Kennedy or I, if I am elected, was a great president?"
13029,-3,-1,"It will not be our ambition that will determine it, because greatness is not something that is written on a campaign poster."
13030,-3,-1,"It will be determined to the extent that we represent the deepest ideals, the highest feelings and faith of the American people."
13031,-3,-1,"In other words, the next president, as he leads America and the free world, can be only as great as the American people are great."
13032,-3,-1,"And so I say in conclusion, keep America's faith strong."
13033,-3,-1,"See that the young people of America, particularly, have faith in the ideals of freedom and faith in God, which distinguishes us from the atheistic materialists who oppose us."
13085,-3,-1,We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin.
13090,-3,-1,"I resent it because th- it's an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war."
13091,-3,-1,I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years.
13092,-3,-1,I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war.
13093,-3,1,There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war.
13094,-3,-1,I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party.
13095,-3,-1,But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record.
13099,-3,-1,"As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn't any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn't any question about what the united American people - Republicans and Democrats alike - would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin."
13105,-3,-1,"Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack."
13106,-3,1,"I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa - which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa - in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn't any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa."
13109,-3,-1,This is the history of dealing with dictators.
13110,-3,-1,This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know.
13114,-3,-1,Now what do the Chinese Communists want?
13116,-3,-1,"And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you're not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that's going to satisfy them, it doesn't satisfy them."
13117,-3,-1,"It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them?"
13124,-3,1,"Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 - ""neither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu."""
13125,-3,-1,"Now, that is the issue."
13126,-3,-1,I believe we must meet our commitment to uh - Formosa.
13127,-3,-1,I support it and the Pescadores Island.
13128,-3,-1,That is the present American position.
13130,-3,1,Mr. Nixon suggests uh - that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked.
13131,-3,-1,"I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there's any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty."
13132,-3,-1,"Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us - as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there's a disagreement - he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa."
13133,-3,1,"Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American."
13134,-3,1,The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area.
13135,-3,1,They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five.
13137,-3,-1,"This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where."
13143,-3,-1,"Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces."
13145,-3,-1,"It may be a long period, but we must - we must get started immediately."
13146,-3,-1,"Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it's possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity."
13150,-3,-1,"And to take a chance uh - now be - and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake."
13152,-3,1,"Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it's been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva."
13155,-3,-1,We may be able to get satisfactory assurances.
13156,-3,-1,It may be necessary for us to begin testing again.
13157,-3,-1,"But I hope the next Administration - and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will - make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels."
13159,-3,-1,"If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves."
13160,-3,-1,"But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war."
13164,-3,-1,"There isn't any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let's have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven't been making an effort, he simply doesn't know what he's talking about."
13165,-3,-1,It isn't a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration.
13168,-3,-1,"We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way."
13170,-3,-1,"Yes, we should make a great effort."
13171,-3,-1,But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust.
13172,-3,-1,There must be an absolute guarantee.
13173,-3,-1,"Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy's last answer."
13174,-3,1,"He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for - which he did - that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment - and on this particular - or for an amendment, I should say - which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve."
13184,-3,1,"As I uh - related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun."
13186,-3,-1,"So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa."
13188,-3,-1,"My point is this: that once you do this - follow this course of action - of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return."
13191,-3,-1,"We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again."
13192,-3,1,"That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy's position in 1955."
13193,-3,1,"And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position - voted with the seventy against the twelve."
13197,-3,-1,"And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace."
13203,-3,1,"Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area."
13204,-3,1,I completely sustained the treaty.
13212,-3,-1,"To me that concept is completely repugnant."""
13213,-3,-1,So I stand with them.
13215,-3,-1,"I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war."
13216,-3,-1,I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun.
13225,-3,-1,They may - are not my style.
13226,-3,-1,"But I really don't think there's anything that I could say to President Truman that's going to cause him, at the age of seventy-six, to change his particular speaking manner."
13228,-3,-1,I'll just have to tell Mr. Morton that.
13229,-3,-1,If you'd pass that message on to him.
13233,-3,-1,"I just do want to say one thing, however."
13234,-3,-1,We all have tempers; I have one; I'm sure Senator Kennedy has one.
13236,-3,0,One thing I've noted as I've traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates.
13239,-3,-1,"It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to."
13241,-3,-1,"And I only hope that, should I win this election, that I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the White House and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say: ""Well, there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that I would want my child to follow."""
13247,-3,-1,"Well, Mr. Cater, of course it's a criticism that uh - is being made."
13251,-3,1,"Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there."
13252,-3,1,"Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President's position throughout."
13253,-3,-1,I think the President was correct in ordering these flights.
13254,-3,-1,"I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on."
13255,-3,0,"I noted, for example, in reading a - uh - a - a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh - his statement about regrets, that uh - he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh - were ones that shouldn't have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh - had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha - uh - had a flight over the United States while uh - he was visiting here."
13257,-3,-1,The answer is that the United States can't afford to have a es- an es - a espionage lack or should we s- uh - lag - or should I say uh - an intelligence lag - any more than we can afford to have a missile lag.
13258,-3,-1,"Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu."
13259,-3,-1,What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands.
13260,-3,1,"Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote - a uh - vote which I've referred to several times - where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position."
13261,-3,-1,"Now, why did they reject it?"
13262,-3,-1,"For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you're going to surrender an area that's free."
13264,-3,-1,Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression.
13266,-3,1,"Well number one on Indochina, Mr. Nixon talked in - before the newspaper editors in the spring of 1954 about putting, and I quote him, ""American boys into Indochina."""
13273,-3,-1,"It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides."
13275,-3,-1,"Number three, the pre - Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu."
13278,-3,1,He didn't take that position on Tibet.
13281,-3,1,Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba.
13284,-3,-1,"And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself."
13293,-3,-1,"I do not suggest in any way, nor have I ever, that that indicates that Mr. Nixon has the slightest sympathy, involvement, or in any way imply any inferences in regard to the Ku Klux Klan."
13296,-3,-1,I would disagree with it.
13298,-3,-1,And that's my view now.
13299,-3,-1,I disapprove of the issue.
13300,-3,-1,I do not suggest that Mr. Nixon does in any way.
13304,-3,-1,We can't settle for anything but the best.
13306,-3,-1,And that means that we can't have any test of religion.
13307,-3,-1,We can't have any test of race.
13308,-3,-1,It must be a test of a man.
13309,-3,-1,Also as far as religion is concerned.
13312,-3,-1,Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together.
13313,-3,-1,We must not be divided on this issue.
13316,-3,-1,We cannot have it in our hearts.
13317,-3,-1,But we certainly cannot have it in a presidential campaign.
13321,-3,-1,"Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week."
13323,-3,-1,"Uh - I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh - as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes."
13324,-3,-1,"Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point."
13325,-3,1,"He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike."
13327,-3,-1,I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure.
13328,-3,-1,"I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a - be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control - all the things that we do not want."
13329,-3,-1,"I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes."
13330,-3,-1,One last point I should make.
13333,-3,-1,"And I only want to say that however good the record is, it's got to be better."
13334,-3,-1,"Because in this critical year - period of the sixties we've got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management."
13335,-3,-1,We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we're in the terrible competition we're in with the Soviets.
13340,-3,1,I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act.
13341,-3,-1,I don't know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about.
13342,-3,-1,"I'm talking about giving him four or five tools - not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations - recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them."
13343,-3,-1,One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure.
13349,-3,-1,"He can provide an injunction if there's a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress."
13358,-3,1,"Yes, I have stated in both uh - debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress."
13362,-3,1,We've spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that.
13363,-3,1,"Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt - merely funding the debt - which is a burden an the taxpayers."
13364,-3,-1,"I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars."
13366,-3,1,"Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged - and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury - out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states - the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors' bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire."
13368,-3,-1,"So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we'd spend more money on housing, we'd spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has."
13369,-3,-1,"But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention."
13374,-3,-1,"Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of ""here-it-is-and-here-it-isn't."""
13382,-3,1,And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program - a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay.
13383,-3,-1,Now are we going to have that when it isn't going to help the farmers?
13384,-3,-1,I don't think we should have that kind of a program.
13385,-3,-1,Then he goes on to say that he's going to change the interest-rate situation and we're going to get some more money that way.
13392,-3,-1,"Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country."
13393,-3,-1,"I'm not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we're in the kind of a race we're in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly."
13394,-3,1,"Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn't good enough."
13395,-3,-1,Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health - all these things we want.
13398,-3,-1,"Now, what do we do about it?"
13399,-3,-1,"And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion."
13400,-3,-1,So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy.
13401,-3,-1,"In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth."
13402,-3,-1,"I refer, for example, to distressed areas."
13404,-3,-1,We also have to see that all of the people of the United States - the tremendous talents that our people have - are used adequately.
13405,-3,-1,"That's why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it's for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need."
13406,-3,-1,"And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth."
13409,-3,-1,Anybody who says America's been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn't been traveling around America.
13413,-3,-1,"But we can and must move faster, and that's why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace."
13417,-3,1,The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread.
13419,-3,1,The t- man who grows tomatoes - it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can.
13421,-3,-1,But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error.
13426,-3,1,But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education.
13427,-3,1,"And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers' salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added."
13428,-3,1,This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth - which means jobs - of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959.
13429,-3,-1,"And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we're going to have to grow more."
13431,-3,1,The Democratic platform and others say five per cent.
13432,-3,-1,Many say four and a half per cent.
13433,-3,1,The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.
13434,-3,-1,That's why we don't have full employment today.
13442,-3,-1,I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay.
13443,-3,-1,That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation.
13446,-3,-1,Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home.
13448,-3,-1,Particularly some of the smaller producers.
13449,-3,1,They're moving about eight or nine days in Texas.
13450,-3,-1,"But I can assure you that if I'm elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully."
13452,-3,-1,"I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward."
13455,-3,-1,I favor the present depletion allowance.
13456,-3,-1,"I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich."
13457,-3,-1,Why do we have a depletion allowance?
13458,-3,-1,"Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it."
13459,-3,-1,"If we didn't have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country."
13461,-3,-1,"And it's because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them."
13465,-3,0,"He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion."
13466,-3,1,"I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you're not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated."
13468,-3,-1,I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned.
13476,-3,-1,"Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar."
13480,-3,-1,This one must be stepped up.
13481,-3,-1,"Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh - we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom."
13483,-3,-1,I think we have been right in carrying it.
13487,-3,-1,"That's why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration - if, of course, I get the opportunity - a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America."
13489,-3,-1,"We can a big share of it, but we've got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about."
13493,-3,-1,"If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn't want to go into it."
13494,-3,-1,Now on the question of gold.
13495,-3,-1,"The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies."
13496,-3,-1,"In other words, if we're going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy."
13497,-3,-1,"We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade."
13498,-3,-1,We have to be able to compete in the world market.
13499,-3,-1,We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh - from abroad if we're going to be able to meet our obligations.
13501,-3,1,"Now there isn't a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods."
13503,-3,-1,We have to be sure to maintain that.
13504,-3,-1,"We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we've maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own."
13508,-3,-1,"Well, I think there are many uh - tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige."
13509,-3,-1,"And the significance of prestige, really, is because we're so identified with the cause of freedom."
13511,-3,-1,There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was.
13515,-3,1,"Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours."
13516,-3,1,Mr. Dulles has suggested it's from two to three times as great as ours.
13518,-3,1,"Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily."
13520,-3,1,"Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries - one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa."
13522,-3,1,A - More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us.
13526,-3,1,"Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years - Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months - both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself."
13528,-3,-1,So I would say our prestige is not so high.
13532,-3,-1,"Well, I would say first of all that Senator's - Kennedy's statement that he's just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isn't going to help our prestige either."
13533,-3,-1,Let's look at the other side of the coin.
13535,-3,-1,Let's look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is.
13537,-3,-1,Its growth rate is not what counts; it's whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us.
13539,-3,-1,"We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what's right."
13540,-3,-1,"And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu."
13542,-3,-1,"In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically."
13543,-3,-1,"Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat."
13544,-3,-1,Let's remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender.
13592,-3,1,"There are many people who believe that the only way we can get this country turned around is to tax the middle class more and punish them more, but the truth is that middle-class Americans are basically the only group of Americans who've been taxed more in the 1980s and during the last 12 years, even though their incomes have gone down."
13593,-3,1,"The wealthiest Americans have been taxed much less, even though their incomes have gone up."
13595,-3,-1,"But my plan is a departure from trickle-down economics, just cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans and getting out of the way."
13597,-3,-1,I propose an American version of what works in other countries -- I think we can do it better: invest and grow.
13598,-3,1,"I believe we can increase investment and reduce the deficit at the same time, if we not only ask the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their share; we also provide over $100 billion in tax relief, in terms of incentives for new plants, new small businesses, new technologies, new housing, and for middle class families; and we have $140 billion of spending cuts."
13600,-3,-1,"Raise some more money, spend the money on tax incentives to have growth in the private sector, take the money from the defense cuts and reinvest it in new transportation and communications and environmental clean-up systems."
13603,-3,-1,I don't believe trickle down economics will work.
13606,-3,-1,I think we can do better if we have the courage to change.
13612,-3,1,"Well, he doesn't like trickle down government but I think he's talking about the Reagan-Bush years where we created 15 million jobs."
13613,-3,1,The rich are paying a bigger percent of the total tax burden.
13614,-3,-1,And what I don't like is trickle down government.
13616,-3,0,"Government -- he says invest government, grow government."
13619,-3,1,It's the private sector that creates jobs.
13620,-3,1,"And yes, we've got too many taxes on the American people and we're spending too much."
13623,-3,-1,I think Mr. Perot put his finger on something there.
13624,-3,-1,It won't be painless but we've got to get the job done.
13625,-3,-1,But not by raising taxes.
13628,-3,-1,I do not want any more trickle down government.
13630,-3,-1,I want to do something about that.
13635,-3,-1,"If you take a patient into the hospital that's bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding."
13636,-3,-1,And we are bleeding arterially.
13638,-3,1,We have spent their money.
13640,-3,-1,"This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice."
13641,-3,1,My plan balances the budget within 6 years.
13645,-3,0,The one thing I have done is lay it squarely on the table in front of the American people.
13654,-3,-1,I disagree with both of them.
13657,-3,1,His own analysis says that unemployment will be slightly higher in 1995 under his plan than it is today.
13658,-3,1,"And as far as what Mr. Bush says, he is the person who raised taxes on the middle class after saying he wouldn't."
13659,-3,1,"And just this year, Mr. Bush vetoed a tax increase on the wealthy that gave middle class tax relief."
13660,-3,1,He vetoed middle class tax relief this year.
13661,-3,1,"And furthermore, under this administration, spending has increased more than it has in the last 20 years and he asked Congress to spend more money than it actually spent."
13663,-3,-1,"So my view is the middle class is the -- they've been suffering, Jim."
13664,-3,-1,"Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can?"
13668,-3,-1,But look what's happened to the middle class.
13670,-3,1,The tax burden on them has not gone down.
13672,-3,-1,"I don't think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector."
13676,-3,-1,I think everybody's paying too much taxes.
13678,-3,1,"Let me remind you it was a Democratic tax increase, and I didn't want to do it and I went along with it."
13679,-3,-1,And I said I make a mistake.
13681,-3,-1,That's quite different than some.
13682,-3,-1,But I think that's the American way.
13688,-3,-1,We don't want to go back to that.
13692,-3,-1,"I mean, look at it, and that's what we're asking America to have?"
13693,-3,1,"Now look, he says Arkansas's a poor state."
13696,-3,-1,I'll give you an example.
13698,-3,1,"Over the last ten years since he's been governor, they're 30% behind, 30% -- they're 30% of the national average."
13701,-3,-1,And I'm going to do that.
13702,-3,0,"It's not dirty campaigning because he's been talking about my record for a half a year here, 11 months here."
13703,-3,-1,So we've got to do that.
13704,-3,-1,I gotta get it in perspective.
13706,-3,1,"Admit it, that Arkansas is doing very, very badly against any standard -- environment, support for police officers, whatever it is."
13708,-3,1,"Mr. Bush's Bureau of Labor Statistics says that Arkansas ranks first in the country in the growth of new jobs this year, first."
13710,-3,1,"4th in manufacturing jobs, 4th in the reduction of poverty, 4th in income increase."
13712,-3,1,Over the last 5 years our income has grown more rapidly than the national average.
13713,-3,1,"We are 2nd in tax burden, the 2nd lowest tax burden in the country."
13714,-3,1,We have the lowest per capita state and local spending in the country.
13715,-3,1,"We're low spending, low tax burden."
13719,-3,0,I grew up 5 blocks from Arkansas.
13720,-3,-1,Let's put it in perspective.
13722,-3,0,It's a fairly rural state.
13723,-3,0,"It has a population less than Chicago or Los Angeles, about the size of Dallas and Forth Worth combined."
13724,-3,-1,So I think probably we're making a mistake night after night after night to cast the nation's future on a unit that small.
13729,-3,0,"No, no, no, but I could say, you know, that I ran a small grocery store on the corner, therefore I extrapolate that into the fact that I can run Wal-Mart."
13734,-3,1,"Mr. Perot, with all respect, I think it is highly relevant, and I think that a 4-billion dollar budget of state and federal funds is not all that small, and I think the fact that I took a state that was one of the poorest states in the country and had been for 153 years and tried my best to modernize its economy and to make the kind of changes that have generated support from people like the presidents of Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard and some of the biggest companies in this country, 24 retired generals and admirals and hundreds of business executives, are highly relevant."
13735,-3,0,"And, you know, I'm frankly amazed that since you grew up 5 blocks from there you would think that what goes on in that state is irrelevant."
13738,-3,-1,And the people who have jobs --
13747,-3,0,"And that institution, the House of Representatives -- everyone is yelling ""Clean House!"""
13749,-3,-1,"What's relevant here is that tool, that discipline, that he has to live by in Arkansas, and I'd like it for the American people."
13750,-3,-1,I want the line-item veto.
13751,-3,-1,"I want a check-off, so if the Congress can't do it, let people check off their income tax, 10% of it, to compel the government to cut spending."
13752,-3,-1,"And if they can't do it, if the Congress can't do it, let them then have to do it across the board."
13759,-3,-1,"Jim, I don't think that's a fair shot."
13761,-3,-1,But I don't think it's fair.
13764,-3,1,I have had it in every single proposal I've sent to the Congress.
13766,-3,-1,I don't think in racial harmony that I'm a laggard on that.
13769,-3,1,"And yes, it took me to veto 2 civil rights quota bills because I don't believe in quotas, and I don't think the American people believe in quotas."
13770,-3,1,"And I beat back the Congress on that, and then we passed a decent civil rights bill that offers guarantees against discrimination in employment."
13772,-3,1,"I've spoken out over and over again against antisemitism and racism, and I think my record as a member of Congress speaks for itself on that."
13773,-3,-1,What was the other part of it?
13776,-3,-1,I don't think that's true at all.
13777,-3,-1,"I don't think that's true, but you know, let others fire away on it."
13779,-3,-1,"I'd like to just talk about issues, and so --"
13782,-3,-1,"See, the subjective thing is when does President Bush react?"
13794,-3,-1,I will let the American people decide that.
13798,-3,1,"The only thing I would say about that is, I think that on the economy, Mr. Bush said for a long time there was no recession, and then said it would be better to do nothing than to have a compromise effort with the Congress."
13799,-3,1,"He really didn't have a new economic program until over 1300 days into his presidency, and not all of his health care initiative has been presented to the Congress even now."
13800,-3,-1,"I think it's important to elect a president who is committed to getting this economy going again, and who realizes we have to abandon trickle-down economics and put the American people first again, and who will send programs to the Congress in the first hundred days to deal with the critical issues that America is crying out for leadership on -- jobs, incomes, the health care crisis, the need to control the economy."
13801,-3,-1,Those things deserve to be dealt with from day one.
13803,-3,-1,"They will be my first priority, not my election year concern."
13806,-3,-1,"But if you're talking about protecting the taxpayer against his friends in the US Congress, go back to what it was like when you had a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress."
13807,-3,-1,You don't have to go back to Herbert Hoover.
13808,-3,1,"Go back to Jimmy Carter, and interest rates were 21%, inflation was 15%."
13809,-3,1,The misery index -- unemployment and inflation added together -- it was invented by the Democrats -- went right through the roof.
13811,-3,-1,And all you hear about is how bad things are.
13812,-3,-1,"You know, remember the question, are you better off?"
13814,-3,-1,Is the senior citizen better off because inflation is not wiping out their family's savings?
13816,-3,-1,Is the guy out of work better off?
13819,-3,-1,You've got to let small businesses have more incentives.
13820,-3,1,"For 3 months -- quarters I've been fighting, 3 quarters been fighting to get the Congress to pass some incentives for small business."
13831,-3,1,I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-'80s while it was still financially strong.
13835,-3,-1,"The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we're still relatively strong."
13837,-3,-1,So the General Motors experience is relevant.
13842,-3,-1,But let's take my life in perspective.
13844,-3,1,"When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed."
13845,-3,0,"And I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years."
13848,-3,-1,I could have rationalized it.
13849,-3,1,"We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home."
13850,-3,0,"And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it's eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort."
13851,-3,0,"Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded."
13852,-3,0,And I didn't wilt and I didn't quit.
13858,-3,-1,"I've lived the American dream; I'd like for your children to be able to live it, too."
13862,-3,-1,"I think what I'd like to talk about a minute, since you're asking the question, is the General Motors issue."
13866,-3,0,They both said they were Vietnam veterans supporting me because I had an economic program to put them back to work.
13867,-3,-1,"We need an investment incentive to modernize plant and equipment; we've got to control the health care costs for those people -- otherwise we can't keep the manufacturing jobs here; and we need a tough trade policy that is fair, that insists on open markets in return for open markets."
13868,-3,-1,We ought to have a strategy that will build the economic and industrial base.
13869,-3,0,So I think Mr. Perot was right in questioning the management practices.
13871,-3,-1,That's one of the things I want to change.
13878,-3,-1,That would break the auto industry and throw a lot of people out of work.
13883,-3,1,I've never heard Governor Clinton make a mistake.
13886,-3,-1,You can't do it as president: you can't have a pattern of one side of the issue one day and another the next.
13890,-3,0,Let's just talk about the CAFE standards -- that's the fuel efficiency standards.
13891,-3,1,They are now 27.5 miles per gallon per automobile fleet.
13892,-3,1,"I never said -- and I defy you to find where I said -- I gave an extensive environmental speech in April, and I said that we ought to have a goal of raising the fuel efficiency standards to 40 miles a gallon."
13894,-3,1,I have never said we should write it into law if there is evidence that that goal cannot be achieved.
13896,-3,-1,I think we should try to raise the fuel efficiency.
13897,-3,-1,And let me say this.
13898,-3,-1,"I think we ought to have incentives to do it, I think we ought to push to do it."
13899,-3,-1,That doesn't mean we have to write it into the law.
13900,-3,-1,"Look, I am a job creator, not a job destroyer."
13901,-3,1,It is the Bush administration that has had no new jobs in the private sector in the last 4 years.
13903,-3,-1,But it is good for America to improve fuel efficiency.
13904,-3,-1,We also ought to convert more vehicles to compressed natural gas.
13908,-3,-1,"Well, everybody's nibbling around the edges."
13909,-3,-1,"Let's go to the center of the bull's-eye, the core problem."
13912,-3,-1,We've got to proceed very carefully on that.
13913,-3,-1,"See, there's a lot I don't understand."
13917,-3,1,And I got a long history of doing that.
13921,-3,1,"Yes, it'll create bubble jobs."
13922,-3,-1,"Now, you know, watch this -- listen very carefully to this."
13924,-3,-1,"Then year after year for decades, they will have jobs."
13925,-3,1,"And I finally -- I thought I didn't understand it -- called all the experts, and they said, oh, it'll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years."
13927,-3,-1,We cannot lose those jobs.
13929,-3,-1,"Makes you feel real good to hear that, right?"
13930,-3,-1,Let's think it through here.
13933,-3,-1,"I hope we'll have a chance to get into that tonight, because I can get right to the center of the bull's-eye and tell you why we're losing whole industries in this country."
13935,-3,-1,"Oh, no, it will cost jobs, but that's not -- let me say this."
13936,-3,-1,"I'd rather, if you gave me 2 bad choices --"
13944,-3,-1,"Kind of gets your head straight about where the taxes, year in and year out, have gotta come from."
13945,-3,0,Millions and millions of people at work.
13948,-3,1,"Ross says, with great conviction, he opposes the North American Free Trade Agreement."
13950,-3,-1,"My problem with Governor Clinton, once again, is that one time he's gonna make up his mind, he sees some merit in it, but then he sees a lot of things wrong with it."
13952,-3,-1,"When you're president of the US, you cannot have this pattern of saying well, I'm for it but I'm on the other side of it."
13953,-3,1,And it's true on this and it's true on CAFE.
13956,-3,-1,I just have an honest philosophical difference.
13957,-3,-1,I think free trade is going to expand our job opportunity.
13958,-3,-1,"I think it is exports that have saved us when we're in a global slowdown, a connected global slowdown, a recession in some countries."
13959,-3,-1,"And it's free trade, fair trade that needs to be our hallmark, and we need more free trade agreements, not fewer."
13962,-3,-1,I'd like to respond to that.
13963,-3,1,"You know, Mr. Bush was very grateful when I was among the Democrats who said he ought to have the authority to negotiate an agreement with Mexico."
13965,-3,-1,I am the one who's in the middle on this.
13966,-3,1,Mr. Perot says it's a bad deal.
13968,-3,-1,"I say on balance it does more good than harm if, if we can get some protection for the environment so that the Mexicans have to follow their own environmental standards, their own labor law standards, and if we have a genuine commitment to reeducate and retrain the American workers who lose their jobs and reinvest in this economy."
13972,-3,1,"Let me just point out, just today in the Los Angeles Times Clyde Prestowitz, who was one of President Reagan's leading trade advisers and a life-long conservative Republican, endorsed my candidacy because he knows that I'll have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed, realistic policy, and not get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did."
13973,-3,-1,"If I wanted to do that, why would I run for president, Jim?"
13975,-3,-1,I want to change it.
13980,-3,-1,You can't do that as president.
13982,-3,-1,This is my point tonight.
13986,-3,-1,"And if you make a mistake, say you made a mistake and go on about your business, trying to serve the American people."
13993,-3,-1,That's what's wrong with Mr. Bush.
13996,-3,-1,"I think the American people are sick and tired of either/or solutions, people being pushed in the corner, polarized to extremes."
13997,-3,-1,I want think they want somebody with common sense who can do what's best for the American people.
14001,-3,0,He promised -- he -- you know -- let me just say --
14003,-3,-1,"I could run this string out a long time, but remember this, Jim."
14005,-3,-1,"I'll be glad to answer any question you have, but this election ought to be about the American people."
14008,-3,-1,Is there an equal time rule tonight?
14010,-3,-1,Or do you just keep lunging in at will?
14011,-3,-1,"I thought we were going to have equal time, but maybe I just have to interrupt the other 2."
14012,-3,-1,Is that the way it works?
14021,-3,-1,"I just want to make -- foreign lobbyists, this whole thing."
14022,-3,1,Our country has sold out to foreign lobbyists.
14024,-3,1,Both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves in key roles in their campaigns.
14026,-3,1,"Every debate I bring this up, and nobody ever addresses it."
14029,-3,-1,"But if I look at the facts as a businessman, it's so tilted, the first thing you ought to do is just say, guys, if you like these deals so well, we'll give you the deal you gave us."
14030,-3,1,"Now, Japanese couldn't unload the cars in this country if they had the same restrictions we had, and on and on and on and on and on."
14031,-3,1,"I suggest to you that the core problem -- 1 country spent $400 million lobbying in 1988, our country."
14033,-3,-1,And you look at a who's who in these campaigns around the 2 candidates.
14035,-3,-1,What do you think they're going to do when the campaign's over?
14037,-3,-1,I don't believe that's in the American people's interest.
14043,-3,1,Most people that are lobbying are lobbying the Congress.
14044,-3,-1,And I don't think there's anything wrong with an honest person who happens to represent an interest of another country for making his case.
14046,-3,-1,And what you're assuming is that that makes the recipient of the lobbying corrupt or the lobbyist himself corrupt.
14047,-3,-1,I don't agree with that.
14050,-3,-1,"Could be wrong, but I think so."
14051,-3,-1,"And as soon as I found it out, he went out the door."
14055,-3,-1,But I don't -- I think you got to look at the integrity and the honor of the people that are being lobbied and those that are lobbyists.
14056,-3,1,The laws protect the American taxpayer in this regard.
14057,-3,-1,"If the laws are violated so much, but to suggest if somebody represents a foreign country on anything, that makes him corrupt or against the taxpayer, I don't agree with that."
14059,-3,1,"We're getting ready to dismantle the airlines industry in our country, and none of you know it."
14060,-3,-1,And I doubt in all candor if the president knows it.
14062,-3,-1,This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry.
14063,-3,1,One of the largest industries in the world is the travel and tourist business.
14064,-3,-1,We won't be making airplanes in this country 10 years from now if we let deals like this go through.
14065,-3,-1,"If the president has any interest tonight, I'll detail it to you; I won't take 10 minutes tonight."
14066,-3,-1,All these things take a few minutes.
14071,-3,1,Japan is trying to get the commercial airline business.
14072,-3,-1,"I don't think there are any villains inside government on this issue, but there's sure a lot of people who don't understand business."
14077,-3,0,"Why, I had a great response to that."
14080,-3,-1,I think Ross is right and that we do need some more restrictions on lobbyists.
14082,-3,-1,"And we ought to have to limit -- we ought to have a much longer period of time, about 5 years, between the time when people can leave executive branch offices and then go out and start lobbying for foreign interests."
14084,-3,1,We've wrecked the airline industry already because of all these leverage buyouts and all these terrible things that have happened to the airline industry.
14086,-3,-1,But the real thing we got to have is a competitive economic strategy.
14087,-3,1,Look what's happening to McDonnell Douglas; even Boeing is losing market share -- because we let the Europeans spend $25-$40 billion on Airbus without an appropriate competitive response.
14088,-3,-1,What I want America to do is to trade more but to compete and win by investing in competitive ways.
14089,-3,-1,And we're in real trouble on that.
14094,-3,0,I heard Gov Clinton congratulate us on 1 thing -- first time he said something pleasant about this administration.
14097,-3,-1,"There are many good ones, but I was glad he acknowledged that."
14100,-3,-1,Now give me 1 second...
14105,-3,-1,"Now, Jim, let me get it out."
14112,-3,-1,"If you all want the enterprise zones, why don't we pass the dang thing and do it, right?"
14125,-3,-1,If I had it to do over again I might answer the questions a little better.
14127,-3,-1,"Going back 23 years, I don't know, Helen."
14128,-3,1,I was opposed to the war.
14130,-3,-1,"I felt very strongly about it, and I didn't want to go at the time."
14134,-3,-1,So the answer is I could do that.
14135,-3,-1,I wouldn't relish doing it but I wouldn't shrink from it.
14136,-3,-1,"I think that the president has to be prepared to use the power of the nation when our vital interests are threatened, when our treaty commitments are at stake, when we know that something has to be done that is in the national interest, and that is a part of being president."
14145,-3,1,On April 17 he said he'd bring out all the records on the draft.
14147,-3,-1,He got a deferment or he didn't.
14148,-3,-1,He got a notice or he didn't.
14149,-3,-1,"And I think it's this pattern that troubles me, more than the draft."
14150,-3,0,"A lot of decent, honorable people felt as he did on the draft."
14154,-3,-1,It wasn't failing to serve.
14159,-3,0,I've spent my whole adult life very close to the military.
14160,-3,-1,I feel very strongly about the people who go into battle for our country.
14161,-3,-1,"I appreciate their idealism, their sacrifices."
14162,-3,-1,Appreciate the sacrifices their families make.
14164,-3,-1,I look on this as history.
14173,-3,-1,I wouldn't have taken any of the alternatives.
14174,-3,-1,I believe that -- I believe I made a mistake.
14176,-3,1,"There was one good thing that came out of that budget agreement, and that is we put a cap on discretionary spending."
14177,-3,1,"One-third of the president's budget is at the president's discretion, or really the Congress, since they appropriate every dime and tell a president how to spend every dime."
14179,-3,1,"But I was wrong because I thought the tax compromise, going along with 1 Democratic tax increase, would help the economy."
14181,-3,-1,So what would I have done?
14182,-3,-1,What should I have done?
14183,-3,-1,"I should have held out for a better deal that would have protected the taxpayer and not ended up doing what we had to do, or what I thought at the time would help."
14184,-3,-1,"So I made a mistake, and I -- you know, the difference, I think, is that I knew at the time I was going to take a lot of political flak."
14187,-3,-1,That's quite different than taking a position where you know it's best for you.
14188,-3,-1,That wasn't best for me and I knew it in the very beginning.
14189,-3,-1,I thought it would be better for the country than it was.
14193,-3,-1,101 in leadership is be accountable for what you do.
14194,-3,-1,Let's go back to the tax and budget summit briefly.
14195,-3,1,Nobody ever told the American people that we increased spending $1.83 for every dollar of taxes raised.
14197,-3,0,Both parties carry a huge blame for that on their shoulders.
14198,-3,-1,This was not a way to pay down the deficit.
14199,-3,-1,This was a trick on the American people.
14201,-3,-1,Let's go back in terms of accepting responsibility for your actions.
14203,-3,-1,"If you create Noriega, using taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake."
14206,-3,-1,"Now, leaders will always make mistakes."
14216,-3,-1,The choices were not good then.
14218,-3,1,That's just what the president did when he vetoed the Family Leave Act.
14220,-3,-1,I made a mistake because I couldn't have foreseen these circumstances and this is the best deal we can work out at the time.
14221,-3,0,"He said it was in the public interest at the time and most everybody who was involved in it, I guess, thought it was."
14234,-3,-1,You've got to go to the people.
14236,-3,-1,I guess it's because you will lose your right to tell them what to think.
14242,-3,-1,You want to have a new program in this country.
14243,-3,-1,"If you get grassroots America excited about it, and if they tap Congress on the shoulder and say do it, Charlie, it'll happen."
14245,-3,-1,"Now, I think that's going back to where we started."
14246,-3,-1,That's having a government from the people.
14251,-3,-1,And I think Ross Perot has done a good job in having them.
14252,-3,1,"And I, as you know, pushed for the debate to include the 209 American citizens who were part of it in Richmond a few days ago."
14253,-3,1,"I've done a lot of them, and I'll continue to do them as president."
14254,-3,0,But I'd also like to point out that I haven't been part of what we're criticizing in Washington tonight.
14255,-3,1,"Of the 3 of us, I have balanced a government budget 12 times, I have offered and passed campaign finance reform, offered, pushed for and passed in public referendum lobbyist restrictions, done the kinds of things you have to do to get legislators together not only to establish consensus but to challenge them to change."
14256,-3,1,And in 12 years as governor I guess I've taken on every interest group there was in my state at one time or another to fight for change.
14258,-3,-1,"That's why I tried to be so specific in this campaign to have a mandate, if elected, so that Congress will know what the American people have voted for."
14262,-3,0,"My favorite bumper sticker, though, is: Annoy the Media."
14264,-3,-1,And I just had to work that in.
14268,-3,0,"Look, you have to build a consensus, but in some things -- Ross mentioned Saddam Hussein."
14269,-3,1,"Yes, we tried, and, yes, we failed to bring him into the family of nations; he had the 4th largest army."
14272,-3,1,"We went to the UN, we made historic resolutions up there, the whole world was united, our Congress was dragging its feet."
14273,-3,1,"Governor Clinton said, well, I might have been with the minority, let sanctions work -- but I guess I would have voted with the majority."
14276,-3,-1,"And in this case I'm glad we did, because if we had let sanctions work and tried to build a consensus on that, Saddam Hussein today would be in Saudi Arabia controlling the world's oil supply, and he would be there maybe with a nuclear weapon."
14277,-3,1,"We busted the 4th largest army, and we did it through leadership."
14284,-3,0,You don't see Margaret Tutwiler sitting in there with me today.
14289,-3,-1,I happen to think she's a key person.
14290,-3,-1,I think our Cabinet members are key people.
14291,-3,-1,"I think the woman that works with me, Rose Zamaria, is about as tough as a boot out there and makes some discipline and protects the taxpayer."
14295,-3,1,"Look at Lynn Martin, who's fighting against this glass ceiling and doing a first-class job on it."
14296,-3,-1,"Look at our surgeon general, Dr. Novello."
14299,-3,-1,"Yeah, I plead guilty to that."
14301,-3,-1,But look who's around with him there.
14302,-3,-1,"I mean, this is a little defensive on your part, Susan, to be honest with you."
14306,-3,-1,"We've got, I think -- you know, you think about women in government, I think about women in business."
14307,-3,-1,Why not try to help them with my small business program to build some incentives into the system?
14308,-3,-1,I think we're making progress here.
14312,-3,-1,-- and we don't need more of them in the Senate or more of them in the House.
14314,-3,1,And we got some very good Republican women running.
14317,-3,0,"Well, I come from the computer business, and everybody knows the women are more talented than the men."
14318,-3,1,So we have a long history of having a lot of talented women.
14319,-3,0,"One of our first officers was a woman, the chief financial officer."
14322,-3,0,"But in terms of being influenced by women and being a minority, there they are right out there, my wife and my 4 beautiful daughters, and I just have 1 son, so he and I are surrounded by women, giving -- telling us what to do all the time."
14324,-3,-1,"And the rest of my minute, I want to make a very brief comment here in terms of Saddam Hussein."
14325,-3,1,"We told him that we wouldn't get involved with his border dispute, and we've never revealed those papers that were given to Ambassador Glaspie on July the 25th."
14326,-3,-1,"I suggest, in the sense of taking responsibility for your actions, we lay those papers on the table."
14331,-3,-1,I've got reply on that.
14332,-3,-1,That gets to the national honor.
14333,-3,1,"We did not say to Saddam Hussein, Ross, you can take the northern part of Kuwait."
14334,-3,-1,"Well, where are the papers?"
14339,-3,1,-- and Glaspie's papers have been presented to the US Senate.
14341,-3,-1,"If you have time, go through Nexis and Lexis, pull all the old news articles, look at what Ambassador Glaspie said all through the fall and what-have-you, and then look at what she and Kelly and all the others in State said at the end when they were trying to clean it up."
14342,-3,-1,And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate.
14346,-3,-1,I'd like to see those written instructions.
14351,-3,0,When I make a mistake I say I'm sorry.
14361,-3,-1,But I think even more relevant is my record at home.
14362,-3,1,For most of my time as governor a woman was my chief of staff.
14363,-3,0,An African American was my chief cabinet officer.
14367,-3,1,"The Natl Women's Political Caucus gave me an award, one of their Good Guy Awards, for my involvement of women in high levels of government, and I've appointed more minorities to positions of high level in government than all the governors in the history of my state combined, before me."
14368,-3,-1,So that's what I'll do as president.
14369,-3,-1,"I don't think we've got a person to waste and I think I owe the American people a White House staff, a Cabinet and appointments that look like America but that meet high standards of excellence, and that's what I'll do."
14381,-3,-1,"And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I'm another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation."
14382,-3,-1,And all of you in the press know exactly what I'm talking about.
14385,-3,0,They interviewed all of my children's friends from childhood on.
14387,-3,1,And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven't had that many lawsuits.
14388,-3,-1,"So that's just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that's running against them."
14389,-3,-1,This goes on night and day.
14390,-3,-1,"I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past."
14393,-3,-1,"Now, let's go back to Saddam Hussein."
14394,-3,1,We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions.
14396,-3,1,"We've never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them."
14398,-3,0,Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that's a fact and it's in all the newspapers.
14400,-3,1,"Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October."
14401,-3,-1,So I say this is very simple.
14402,-3,1,"Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, where she said we will not become involved in your border dispute and, in effect, you can take the northern part of the country."
14405,-3,-1,What were her written instructions?
14406,-3,0,"We guard those like the secrets of the atomic bomb, literally."
14407,-3,-1,"Now, I say whose country is this?"
14409,-3,-1,Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table?
14410,-3,-1,"The worst thing is, again, it's a mistake."
14411,-3,-1,Nobody did any of this with evil intent.
14413,-3,-1,"Whether it's Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it's a steady stream."
14418,-3,-1,But let's look at where I think the real mistake was made.
14419,-3,1,"In 1988 when the war between Iraq and Iran ended, we knew Saddam Hussein was a tyrant, we had dealt with him because he was against Iran -- the enemy of my enemy maybe is my friend."
14420,-3,1,"All right, the war's over; we know he's dropping mustard gas on his own people, we know he's threatened to incinerate half of Israel."
14421,-3,1,Several government departments -- several -- had information that he was converting our aid to military purposes and trying to develop weapons of mass destruction.
14425,-3,-1,"Well, it's awful easy when you're dealing with 90-90 hindsight."
14426,-3,1,We did try to bring Saddam Hussein into the family of nations; he did have the 4th largest army.
14429,-3,1,"And we formed a historic coalition, and we brought him down, and we destroyed the 4th largest army."
14430,-3,1,"And the battlefield was searched, and there wasn't one single iota of evidence that any US weapons were on that battlefield."
14431,-3,1,"And the nuclear capability has been searched by the United Nations, and there hasn't been one single scintilla of evidence that there's any US technology involved in it."
14432,-3,-1,And what you're seeing on all this Iraq-gate is a bunch of people who were wrong on the war trying to cover their necks here and try to do a little revisionism.
14434,-3,1,"Yes, we had grain credits for Iraq, and there isn't any evidence that those grain credits were diverted into weaponry -- none, none whatsoever."
14436,-3,-1,"And so I just have to say, it's fine."
14438,-3,-1,"Come on, that's not leadership."
14448,-3,1,"The mistake that both parties made in Washington with the S&L business was deregulating them without proper capital requirements, proper oversight and regulation, proper training of the executives."
14452,-3,1,"We don't want to overreact, as the federal regulators have in my judgment, on good banks so that they've created credit crunches, that is, they have made our recession worse in the last couple of years -- but we do want to act prudently with the banks that are in trouble."
14453,-3,-1,We also want to say that insofar as is humanly possible the banking industry itself should pay for the cost of any bank failures; the taxpayers should not.
14455,-3,-1,"And I believe if we have a good balanced approach, we can get the good banks loaning money again, end the credit crunch, have proper regulation on the ones that are in trouble, and not overreact."
14456,-3,-1,"It is a serious problem, but I don't see it as the kind of terrible, terrible problem that the S&L problem was."
14458,-3,-1,"Well, I don't believe it would be appropriate for a president to suggest that the banking system is not sound."
14461,-3,-1,"But what we need is financial reform; we need some real financial reform, banking reform legislation."
14467,-3,1,The whole problem came up in 1984.
14468,-3,1,The president of the US was told officially it was a $20-billion problem.
14471,-3,-1,I believe the vice president was in charge of deregulation.
14475,-3,1,"Now, if you believe The Washington Post and you believe this extensive study that's been done -- and I'm reading it -- right after election day this year they're going to hit us with a hundred banks, it will be a $100-billion problem."
14476,-3,-1,"Now, if that's true, just tell me now."
14478,-3,-1,But just tell me now; don't bury until after the election twice.
14480,-3,-1,"The people deserve that since we have to pick up the tab; you got the PAC money, we'll pay the tab."
14486,-3,-1,The debt and the deficit.
14489,-3,-1,"A shameless plug there, Mr. President."
14490,-3,-1,But in a nutshell we've got to reform our government or we won't get anything done.
14491,-3,-1,We have a government that doesn't work.
14492,-3,-1,"All these specific examples I'm giving tonight -- if you had a business like that, they'd be leading you away and boarding up the doors."
14495,-3,-1,The people need to take their government back.
14496,-3,-1,"You've got to reform Congress, they've got to be servants of the people again; you've got to reform the White House."
14497,-3,-1,We've got to turn this thing around.
14500,-3,-1,But very specifically the key thing is to turn the government back to the people and take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve.
14502,-3,-1,Who would have 1200 airplanes worth 2 billion a year just to fly around in?
14503,-3,0,"I don't have a free reserved parking place at Natl Airport, why should my servants?"
14507,-3,-1,"And it is silly putty, folks, and the American people have had enough of it."
14508,-3,-1,"Step one, if I get up there, we're going to clean that up."
14509,-3,-1,"You say, how can I get Congress to do that?"
14510,-3,-1,"I'll have millions of people at my shoulder, shoulder to shoulder with me, and we will see it done work speed -- because it's wrong."
14516,-3,1,I've called for a 25% reduction in congressional staffs and expenditures.
14517,-3,1,"But the White House staff increased its expenditures by considerably more than Congress has in the last 4 years under the Bush administration, and Congress has actually spent a billion dollars less than President Bush asked them to spend."
14518,-3,-1,"Now, when you out-spend Congress you're really swinging."
14523,-3,-1,We've gotta get this country growing again and this economy strong again or we can't bring down the deficit.
14532,-3,-1,"Well, how about this for a government reform policy?"
14533,-3,-1,Reduce the White House staff by a 3rd after or at the same time the Congress does the same thing for their staff.
14534,-3,-1,Term limits for members of the US Congress.
14535,-3,-1,Give the government back to the people.
14536,-3,-1,Let's do it that way.
14537,-3,0,The president has term limits.
14538,-3,-1,Let's limit some of these guys sitting out here tonight.
14541,-3,-1,And then how about a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution?
14542,-3,1,"Forty-3 -- more than that -- states have it, I believe."
14544,-3,-1,And you want to do something about all this extra spending that concerns Mr. Perot and me?
14546,-3,-1,How about a line item veto?
14548,-3,-1,"And give it to the president, and if the Congress isn't big enough to do it, let the president have a shot at this excess spending."
14552,-3,-1,"Well, that's the only protection the taxpayer has against some of these reckless pork programs up there, and I'd rather be able to just line it right out of there and get on about passing some good stuff but leave out the garbage."
14564,-3,-1,"Now, I'll tell ya this."
14565,-3,-1,I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.
14566,-3,-1,"If the money does not come in there to pay for these programs, we will cut other government spending or we will slow down the phase-in of the programs."
14567,-3,-1,I am not gonna raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs.
14568,-3,-1,"Now furthermore, I am not gonna tell you ""read my lips"" on anything because I cannot foresee what emergencies might develop in this country."
14569,-3,1,"And the president said never, never, never would he raise taxes in New Jersey, and within a day Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman, said now, that's not a promise."
14570,-3,-1,"So I think even he has learned that you can't say ""read my lips"" because you can't know what emergencies might come up."
14571,-3,-1,But I can tell you this.
14574,-3,-1,And you know how you can trust me about that?
14578,-3,-1,I'll make some news in the 3rd debate.
14583,-3,-1,That's what worries me --
14587,-3,-1,He would do for the US what he's done to Arkansas.
14588,-3,-1,We do not want to be the lowest of the low.
14591,-3,1,We are a rising nation.
14594,-3,-1,"To get it, to get $150 billion in new taxes, you got to go down to the guy that's making $36,600."
14595,-3,-1,"And if you want to pay for the rest of his plan, all the other spending programs, you're going to sock it to the working man."
14596,-3,-1,"So when you hear ""tax the rich,"" Mr. and Mrs. America, watch your wallet."
14601,-3,1,"Jim, you permitted Mr. Bush to break the rules, he said, to defend the honor of the country."
14602,-3,-1,What about the honor of my state?
14603,-3,1,"We rank first in the country in job growth, we got the lowest spending, state and local, in the country, and the 2nd lowest tax burden."
14614,-3,-1,I'm sure I'll do it before it's over.
14618,-3,-1,"I think -- you know, I'm starting to understand it."
14619,-3,-1,"You stay around this long enough, you think about -- if you talk about it in Washington, you think you did it."
14620,-3,-1,"If you've been on television about it, you think you did it."
14622,-3,-1,What we need is people to stop talking and start doing.
14624,-3,1,The Wall Street Journal said your numbers don't add up.
14625,-3,1,"And you can take it out on charts, you look at all the studies the different groups have done, you go out 4, 5, 6 years, we're still drifting along with a huge deficit."
14626,-3,-1,"So let's come back to harsh reality, and what I -- you know, everybody says, gee, Perot, you're tough."
14627,-3,-1,"I'm saying, well, this is not as tough as World War II and it's not as tough as the revolution."
14628,-3,-1,"And it's fair, shared sacrifice to do the right thing for our country and for our children."
14629,-3,-1,And it will be fun if we all work together to do it.
14636,-3,-1,"Well, I think the answer to why the drop, I think, has been the economy in the doldrums."
14637,-3,-1,Why I'll win is I think I have the best plan of the 3 of us up here to do something about it.
14644,-3,1,They're almost at the bottom on every single category.
14645,-3,-1,We can't do that to the American people.
14646,-3,1,"And then, Helen, I really believe where people are going to ask this question about trust, because I do think there's a pattern by Governor Clinton of saying one thing to please one group, and then trying to please another group."
14647,-3,-1,And I think that pattern is a dangerous thing to suggest would work for the Oval Office.
14648,-3,-1,It doesn't work that way when you're president.
14651,-3,-1,And you have to make decisions even when it's against your own interest.
14654,-3,-1,So I think people are going to be looking for trust and experience.
14656,-3,-1,And so I'll make the appeal on a wide array of issues.
14657,-3,-1,Also I got a philosophical difference.
14661,-3,1,We're doing better than a lot of the countries in the world.
14662,-3,-1,And we're going to lead the way out of this economic recession across this world and economic slowdown here at home.
14664,-3,-1,That's why I think I'll win.
14673,-3,1,I'm totally focussed on the fact that we are still evading the issue of the Glaspie papers.
14675,-3,-1,"So I am still focussed on gridlock, I guess."
14676,-3,1,"And I am also focussed on the fact that isn't it a paradox that we have the highest productivity in our workforce in the industrialized world and at the same time have the largest trade deficit, and at the same time rank behind 9 other nations in what we pay our most productive people in the world, and we're losing whole industries overseas."
14677,-3,-1,"Now, can't somebody agree with me that the government is breaking business's legs with these trade agreements?"
14678,-3,-1,They're breaking business's legs in a number of different ways.
14680,-3,0,Keep in mind a factory worker has nothing to do with anything except putting it together on the factory floor.
14681,-3,-1,It's our obligation to make sure that we give him the finest products in the world to put together and we don't break his legs in the process.
14683,-3,1,"I really can't believe Mr. Bush is still trying to make trust an issue after ""read my lips"" and 15 million new jobs and embracing what he called voodoo economics and embracing an export enhancement program for farmers he threatened to veto and going all around the country giving out money in programs that he once opposed."
14685,-3,-1,They don't want us talking about each other.
14691,-3,1,"Look at Sarah Brady, Jim Brady's wife, President Reagan's press secretary, who endorsed me because he knuckled under to the NRA and wouldn't fight for the Brady Bill."
14692,-3,-1,"We've got a broad-based coalition that goes beyond party because I am going to change this country and make it better, with the help of the American people."
14700,-3,-1,"First, I'd like to thank the commission and my opponents for participating in these debates and making them possible."
14701,-3,-1,I think the real winners of the debates were the American people.
14705,-3,-1,"I'd like to say to Mr. Bush, even though I've got profound differences with him, I do honor his service to our country."
14706,-3,-1,I appreciate his efforts and I wish him well.
14707,-3,-1,I just believe it's time to change.
14710,-3,1,It's been tried for 12 years and it's failed.
14711,-3,1,"More people are working harder for less, 100,000 people a month losing their health insurance, unemployment going up, our economy slowing down."
14714,-3,-1,"It's invest and grow, put our people first, control health care costs and provide basic health care to all Americans, have an education system 2nd to none and revitalize the private economy."
14715,-3,-1,That is my commitment to you.
14716,-3,-1,It is the kind of change that can open up a whole new world of opportunities to America as we enter the last decade of this century and move towards the 21st century.
14717,-3,-1,"I want a country where people who work hard and play by the rules are rewarded, not punished."
14718,-3,-1,I want a country where people are coming together across the lines of race and region and income.
14719,-3,-1,I know we can do better.
14720,-3,-1,"It won't take miracles and it won't happen overnight, but we can do much, much better if we have the courage to change."
14725,-3,-1,"On jobs -- that's the number one priority, and I believe my program for stimulating investment, encouraging small business, brand-new approach to education, strengthening the American family, and, yes, creating more exports is the way to go."
14730,-3,1,The whole world is having economic difficulties.
14731,-3,0,The US is doing better than a lot.
14732,-3,-1,But we've got to do even better.
14733,-3,-1,"And if a crisis comes up, I ask who has the judgment and the experience and, yes, the character to make the right decision?"
14738,-3,-1,"And so the question is, who will safeguard this nation, who will safeguard our people and our children?"
14739,-3,-1,"I need your support, I ask for your vote."
14740,-3,-1,And may God bless the US of America.
14743,-3,-1,"To the millions of fine decent people who did the unthinkable and took their country back in their own hands and put me on the ballot, let me pledge to you that tonight is just the beginning."
14746,-3,-1,"Now, the question is, can we win?"
14747,-3,-1,"Absolutely we can win, because it's your country."
14750,-3,-1,"Now, you got to stop letting these people tell you who to vote for, you got to stop letting these folks in the press tell you you're throwing your vote away -- you got to start using your own head."
14754,-3,-1,"The ""we"" is you and me."
14755,-3,-1,"You bet your hat we can govern because we will be in there together and we will figure out what to do, and you won't tolerate gridlock, you won't tolerate endless meandering and wandering around, and you won't tolerate non-performance."
14757,-3,-1,Together we can get anything done.
14760,-3,-1,"Pretty simply, who's the best-qualified person up here on the stage to create jobs?"
14762,-3,-1,I suggest you might consider somebody who's created jobs.
14763,-3,-1,Who's the best person to manage money?
14765,-3,-1,Who's the best person to get results and not talk?
14766,-3,-1,Look at the record and make your decision.
14767,-3,-1,"And, finally, who would you give your pension fund and your savings account to manage?"
14768,-3,-1,"And, last one, who would you ask to be the trustee of your estate and take care of your children if something happened to you?"
14771,-3,-1,"To the American people, I'm doing this because I love you."
14809,-3,-1,"I don't know what the differences might be, because I don't know what Mr. Carter's policies are."
14810,-3,0,I do know what he has said about mine.
14811,-3,-1,"And I'm only here to tell you that I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security."
14812,-3,-1,"Now, I believe, also, that this meeting this mission, this responsibility for preserving the peace, which I believe is a responsibility peculiar to our country, and that we cannot shirk our responsibility as a leader of the free world because we're the only ones that can do it."
14813,-3,-1,"Therefore, the burden of maintaining the peace falls on us."
14814,-3,-1,And to maintain that peace requires strength.
14815,-3,-1,America has never gotten in a war because we were too strong.
14818,-3,0,I have seen four wars in my lifetime.
14819,-3,0,I'm a father of sons; I have a grandson.
14820,-3,-1,"I don't ever want to see another generation of young Americans bleed their lives into sandy beachheads in the Pacific, or rice paddies and jungles in the in Asia or the muddy battlefields of Europe."
14827,-3,1,And my tax cut does not come close to eliminating that $86 billion increase.
14829,-3,-1,"In other words, what I'm talking about is not putting government back to getting less money than government's been getting, but simply cutting the increase in in spending."
14837,-3,-1,"And with each one of those decisions that affect the future of my country, I have learned in the process."
14839,-3,-1,I've also learned that there are no simple answers to complicated questions.
14840,-3,-1,H. L. Mencken said that for every problem there's a simple answer.
14842,-3,1,"The fact is that this nation, in the eight years before I became President, had its own military strength decreased."
14843,-3,1,"Seven out of eight years, the budget commitments for defense went down, 37% in all."
14845,-3,-1,But what we've done is use that enormous power and prestige and military strength of the United States to preserve the peace.
14846,-3,-1,"We've not only kept peace for our own country, but we've been able to extend the benefits of peace to others."
14848,-3,-1,"This is a very good step forward for our nation's security, and we'll continue to do as we have done in the past."
14849,-3,-1,I might also add that there are decisions that are made in the Oval Office by every President which are profound in nature.
14850,-3,-1,"There are always trouble spots in the world, and how those troubled areas are addressed by a President alone in that Oval Office affects our nation directly, the involvement of the United States and also our American interests."
14851,-3,-1,"That is a basic decision that has to be made so frequently, by every President who serves."
14859,-3,-1,"In the past, we have not had an adequate military presence in that region."
14862,-3,-1,"And we've made it clear that working with our allies and others, that we are prepared to address any foreseeable eventuality which might interrupt commerce with that crucial area of the world."
14867,-3,1,"I would call to your attention that we were in a war that wound down during those eight years, which of course made a change in military spending because of turning from war to peace."
14868,-3,1,"I also would like to point out that Republican presidents in those years, faced with a Democratic majority in both houses of the Congress, found that their requests for defense budgets were very often cut."
14869,-3,1,"Now, Gerald Ford left a five-year projected plan for a military build-up to restore our defenses, and President Carter's administration reduced that by 38%, cut 60 ships out of the Navy building program that had been proposed, and stopped the the B-l, delayed the cruise missile, stopped the production line for the Minuteman missile, stopped the Trident or delayed the Trident submarine, and now is planning a mobile military force that can be delivered to various spots in the world which does make me question his assaults on whether I am the one who is quick to look for use of force."
14871,-3,-1,"Well, there are various elements of defense."
14872,-3,-1,"One is to control nuclear weapons, which I hope we'll get to later on because that is the most important single issue in this campaign."
14873,-3,-1,Another one is how to address troubled areas of the world.
14876,-3,-1,"But I'll always remember that the best weapons are the ones that are never fired in combat, and the best soldier is one who never has to lay his life down on the field of battle."
14877,-3,-1,"Strength is imperative for peace, but the two must go hand in hand."
14887,-3,-1,Again it's important to put the situation in perspective.
14891,-3,1,The recession that resulted this time was the briefest since the Second World War.
14893,-3,1,"Earlier this year, in the first quarter, we did have a very severe inflation pressure brought about by the OPEC price increase."
14894,-3,1,It averaged about 18% in the first quarter of this year.
14895,-3,1,"In the second quarter, we had dropped it down to about 13%."
14896,-3,1,"The most recent figures, the last three months, on the third quarter of this year, the inflation rate is 7% - still too high, but it illustrates very vividly that in addition to providing an enormous number of jobs - nine million new jobs in the last three and a half years - that the inflationary threat is still urgent on us."
14898,-3,1,"which his own running mate, George Bush, described as voodoo economics, and said that it would result in a 30% inflation rate."
14900,-3,-1,"So our proposals are very sound and very carefully considered to stimulate jobs, to improve the industrial complex of this country, to create tools for American workers, and at the same time would be anti-inflationary in nature."
14901,-3,-1,"So to add nine million new jobs, to control inflation, and to plan for the future with an energy policy now intact as a foundation is our plan for the years ahead."
14910,-3,1,"As a matter of fact, we're importing today about one-third less oil from overseas than we did just a year ago."
14912,-3,1,"At the same time, as I have said earlier, we have added about nine million net new jobs in that period of time - a record never before achieved."
14913,-3,1,"Also, the new energy policy has been predicated on two factors: One is conservation, which requires sacrifice, and the other one, increase in production of American energy, which is going along very well - more coal this year than ever before in American history, more oil and gas wells drilled this year than ever before in history."
14914,-3,-1,"The new economic revitalization program that we have in mind, which will be implemented next year, would result in tax credits which would let business invest in new tools and new factories to create even more new jobs - about one million in the next two years."
14915,-3,1,"And we also have planned a youth employment program which would encompass 600,000 jobs for young people."
14923,-3,-1,"Mr. Ellis, I think this idea that has been spawned here in our country that inflation somehow came upon us like a plague and therefore it's uncontrollable and no one can do anything about it, is entirely spurious and it's dangerous to say this to the people."
14924,-3,1,"When Mr. Carter became President, inflation was 4.8%, as you said."
14929,-3,1,"But that can't hide the fact that there are eight million men and women out of work in America today, and two million of those lost their jobs in just the last few months."
14931,-3,1,"And yet, his 1980 economic message stated that we would reduce productivity and gross national product and increase unemployment in order to get a handle on inflation, because in January, at the beginning of the year, it was more than 18%."
14932,-3,-1,"Since then, he has blamed the people for inflation, OPEC, he has blamed the Federal Reserve system, he has blamed the lack of productivity of the American people, he has then accused the people of living too well and that we must share in scarcity, we must sacrifice and get used to doing with less."
14934,-3,-1,We have inflation because the Government is living too well.
14938,-3,-1,"Yes, you can lick inflation by increasing productivity and by decreasing the cost of government to the place that we have balanced budgets, and are no longer grinding out printing press money, flooding the market with it because the Government is spending more than it takes in."
14939,-3,-1,And my economic plan calls for that.
14941,-3,-1,But we will have a very poor nation and a very unsound economy if we follow that path.
14949,-3,-1,"most people, when they think about cutting Government spending, they think in terms of eliminating necessary programs or wiping out something, some service that Government is supposed to perform."
14950,-3,-1,I believe that there is enough extravagance and fat in government.
14951,-3,1,"As a matter of fact, one of the secretaries of HEW under Mr. Carter testified that he thought there was $7 billion worth of fraud and waste in welfare and in the medical programs associated with it."
14952,-3,1,We've had the Central Accounting.
14953,-3,1,"Office estimate that there is probably tens of billions of dollars that is lost in fraud alone, and they have added that waste adds even more to that."
14954,-3,-1,"We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts could be made."
14955,-3,1,I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in California.
14956,-3,1,And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the money to the people and reduced Government spending.
14961,-3,1,"One of those ideas was to repeal the minimum wage, and several times this year, Governor Reagan has said that the major cause of unemployment is the minimum wage."
14962,-3,-1,"This is a heartless kind of approach to the working families of our country, which is typical of many Republican leaders of the past, but, I think, has been accentuated under Governor Reagan."
14963,-3,1,In California - I'm surprised Governor Reagan brought this up - he had the three largest tax increases in the history of that state under his administration.
14970,-3,1,"The figures that the President has just used about California is a distortion of the situation there, because while I was Governor of California, our spending in California increased less per capita than the spending in Georgia while Mr. Carter was Governor of Georgia in the same four years."
14971,-3,1,The size of government increased only one-sixth in California of what it increased in proportion to the population in Georgia.
14972,-3,-1,"And the idea that my tax-cut proposal is inflationary: I would like to ask the President why is it inflationary to let the people keep more of their money and spend it the way that they like, and it isn't inflationary to let him take that money and spend it the way he wants?"
14980,-3,-1,"Let the local entity, the city, declare this particular area, based on the standards of the percentage of people on welfare, unemployed, and so forth, in that area."
14981,-3,-1,"And then, through tax incentives, induce the creation of businesses providing jobs and so forth in those areas."
14983,-3,-1,"And there would simply be a delay, and on the other hand, many of the people who would then be given jobs are presently wards of the Government and it wouldn't hurt to give them a tax incentive, because they... that wouldn't be costing Government anything either."
14984,-3,-1,I think there are things to do in this regard.
14985,-3,0,I stood in the South Bronx on the exact spot that President Carter stood on in 1977.
14986,-3,-1,You have to see it to believe it.
15006,-3,-1,"But I believe that all of us together, and I believe the Presidency is what Teddy Roosevelt said it was."
15008,-3,-1,"And I think that something can be done from there, because a goal for all of us should be that one day, things will be done neither because of nor in spite of any of the differences between us - ethnic differences or racial differences, whatever they may be - that we will have total equal opportunity for all people."
15009,-3,-1,And I would do everything I could in my power to bring that about.
15018,-3,-1,This has been a very successful effort.
15020,-3,1,"Of the nine million people put to work in new jobs since I've been in office, 1.3 million of those has been among black Americans, and another million among those who speak Spanish."
15021,-3,-1,"We now are planning to continue the revitalization program with increased commitments of rapid transit, mass transit."
15022,-3,1,"Under the windfall profits tax, we expect to spend about $43 billion in the next 10 years to rebuild the transportation systems of our country."
15023,-3,0,We also are pursuing housing programs.
15024,-3,1,We've had a 73% increase in the allotment of Federal funds for improved education.
15026,-3,-1,It's very important to us that this be done with the full involvement of minority citizens.
15029,-3,-1,Those who suffered from discrimination because of race or sex certainly knew we had a racial problem.
15030,-3,-1,"We have gone a long way toward correcting these problems, but we still have a long way to go."
15041,-3,1,"Since I've been President, I've appointed, for instance, more than twice as many black Federal judges as all previous presidents in the history of this country."
15042,-3,1,"I've done the same thing in the appointment of women, and also Spanish-speaking Americans."
15043,-3,-1,To involve them in the administration of government and the feeling that they belong to the societal structure that makes decisions in the judiciary and in the executive branch is a very important commitment which I am trying to realize and will continue to do so in the future.
15046,-3,-1,"The President talks of Government programs, and they have their place."
15048,-3,-1,They were public employment that these people who really want to get out into the private job market where there are jobs with a future.
15053,-3,1,"With regard to the great progress that has been made with this Government spending, the rate of black unemployment in Detroit, Michigan, is 56%."
15055,-3,-1,It's obvious that we still have a long way to go in fully incorporating the minority groups into the mainstream of American life.
15059,-3,-1,"There is no doubt in my mind that in the downtown central cities, with the, with the new commitment on an energy policy, with a chance to revitalize homes and to make them more fuel efficient, with a chance for our synthetic fuels program, solar power, this will give us an additional opportunity for jobs which will pay rich dividends."
15066,-3,-1,"Barbara, one of the blights on this world is the threat and the activities of terrorists."
15069,-3,1,"There is no doubt that we have seen in recent years - in recent months - additional acts of violence against Jews in France and, of course, against those who live in Israel, by the PLO and other terrorist organizations."
15070,-3,-1,"Ultimately, the most serious terrorist threat is if one of those radical nations, who believe in terrorism as a policy, should have atomic weapons."
15072,-3,1,"In countries like Libya or Iraq, we have even alienated some of our closest trade partners because we have insisted upon the control of the spread of nuclear weapons to those potentially terrorist countries."
15075,-3,-1,"This ultimate terrorist threat is the most fearsome of all, and it's part of a pattern where our country must stand firm to control terrorism of all kinds."
15083,-3,1,"When I made my decision to stop all trade with Iran as a result of the taking of our hostages, I announced then, and have consistently maintained since then, that if the hostages are released safely, we would make delivery on those items which Iran owns - which they have bought and paid for - also, that the frozen Iranian assets would be released."
15094,-3,-1,"Now, this comes from an answer that I've made at least 50 times during this campaign to the press, when I am asked have you any ideas of what you would do if you were there?"
15095,-3,-1,"And I said, well, yes."
15096,-3,-1,"And I think that anyone that's seeking this position, as well as other people, probably, have thought to themselves, what about this, what about that?"
15097,-3,-1,"These are just ideas of what I would think of if I were in that position and had access to the information, and which I would know all the options that were open to me."
15098,-3,-1,"I have never answered the question, however; second, the one that says, well, tell me, what are some of those ideas?"
15099,-3,-1,"First of all, I would be fearful that I might say something that was presently under way or in negotiations, and thus expose it and endanger the hostages, and sometimes, I think some of my ideas might require quiet diplomacy where you don't say in advance, or say to anyone, what it is you're thinking of doing."
15101,-3,-1,"What I do think should be done, once they are safely here with their families, and that tragedy is over - we've endured this humiliation for just lacking one week of a year now - then, I think, it is time for us to have a complete investigation as to the diplomatic efforts that were made in the beginning, why they have been there so long, and when they came home, what did we have to do in order to bring that about - what arrangements were made?"
15102,-3,-1,And I would suggest that Congress should hold such an investigation.
15103,-3,-1,"In the meantime, I'm going to continue praying that they'll carne home."
15110,-3,-1,And we've been guilty of that.
15114,-3,1,"And that was, we had adequate warning that there was a threat to our embassy, and we could have done what other embassies did - either strengthen our security there, or remove our personnel before the kidnap and the takeover took place."
15117,-3,1,I didn't hear any comment from Governor Reagan about what he would do to stop or reduce terrorism in the future.
15118,-3,1,"What the Western allies did decide to do is to stop all air flights - commercial air flights - to any nation involved in terrorism or the hijacking of air planes, or the harboring of hijackers."
15119,-3,-1,"Secondly, we all committed ourselves, as have all my predecessors in the Oval Office not to permit the spread of nuclear weapons to a terrorist nation, or to any other nation that does not presently have those weapons or capabilities for explosives."
15120,-3,-1,"Third, not to make any sales of materiel or weapons to a nation which is involved in terrorist activities."
15121,-3,-1,"And, lastly, not to deal with the PLO until and unless the PLO recognizes Israel's right to exist and recognizes UN Resolution 242 as a basis for Middle East peace."
15126,-3,-1,"And while I have a last word here, I would like to correct a misstatement of fact by the President."
15143,-3,-1,"I think I'm right because I believe that we must have a consistent foreign policy, a strong America, and a strong economy."
15145,-3,1,The SALT II treaty was the result of negotiations that Mr. Carter's team entered into after he had asked the Soviet Union for a discussion of actual reduction of nuclear strategic weapons.
15147,-3,1,"But taking that one no from the Soviet Union, we then went back into negotiations on their terms, because Mr. Carter had canceled the B-I bomber, delayed the MX, delayed the Trident submarine, delayed the cruise missile, shut down the Missile Man - the three - the Minuteman missile production line, and whatever other things that might have been done."
15150,-3,1,It has been blocked by a Senate in which there is a Democratic majority.
15151,-3,1,"Indeed, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 10 to 0, with seven abstentions, against the SALT II treaty, and declared that it was not in the national security interests of the United States."
15152,-3,1,"Besides which, it is illegal, because the law of the land, passed by Congress, says that we cannot accept a treaty in which we are not equal."
15153,-3,-1,And we are not equal in this treaty for one reason alone - our B-2 bombers are considered to be strategic weapons; their Backfire bombers are not.
15165,-3,-1,"unemployment, the cities are all very important issues, but they pale into insignificance in the life and duties of a President when compared with the control of nuclear weapons."
15168,-3,1,"He has never supported any of those arms control agreements - the limited test ban, SALT I, nor the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, nor the Vladivostok Treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Ford - and now he wants to throw into the wastebasket a treaty to control nuclear weapons on a balanced and equal basis between ourselves and the Soviet Union, negotiated over a seven-year period, by myself and my two Republican predecessors."
15169,-3,0,The Senate has not voted yet on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty.
15170,-3,1,"There have been preliminary skirmishing in the committees of the Senate, but the Treaty has never come to the floor of the Senate for either a debate or a vote."
15172,-3,0,"You've got 99 other senators to correct that mistake, if it is a mistake."
15173,-3,-1,"But when a man who hopes to be President says, take this treaty, discard it, do not vote, do not debate, do not explore the issues, do not finally capitalize on this long negotiation - that is a very dangerous and disturbing thing."
15175,-3,-1,"Yes, I'd like to respond very much."
15176,-3,-1,"First of all, the Soviet Union if I have been critical of some of the previous agreements, it's because we've been out-negotiated for quite a long time."
15177,-3,1,"And they have managed, in spite of all of our attempts at arms limitation, to go forward with the biggest military build-up in the history of man."
15178,-3,1,"Now, to suggest that because two Republican presidents tried to pass the SALT treaty - that puts them on its side - I would like to say that President Ford, who was within 90% of a treaty that we could be in agreement with when he left office, is emphatically against this SALT treaty."
15180,-3,-1,I am not talking of scrapping.
15182,-3,-1,"And I would say to the Soviet Union, we will sit and negotiate with you as long as it takes, to have not only legitimate arms limitation, but to have a reduction of these nuclear weapons to the point that neither one of us represents a threat to the other."
15183,-3,-1,That is hardly throwing away a treaty and being opposed to arms limitation.
15186,-3,-1,Governor Reagan is making some very misleading and disturbing statements.
15187,-3,1,"He not only advocates the scrapping of this treaty - and I don't know that these men that he quotes are against the treaty in its final form - but he also advocates the possibility, he said it's been a missing element, of playing a trump card against the Soviet Union of a nuclear arms race, and is insisting upon nuclear superiority by our own nation, as a predication for negotiation in the future with the Soviet Union."
15188,-3,-1,"If President Brezhnev said, we will scrap this treaty, negotiated under three American Presidents over a seven-year period of time, we insist upon nuclear superiority as a basis for future negotiations, and we believe that the launching of a nuclear arms race is a good basis for future negotiations, it's obvious that I, as President, and all Americans, would reject such a proposition."
15191,-3,-1,"It would change the basic tone and commitment that our nation has experienced ever since the Second World War, with al Presidents, Democratic and Republican."
15193,-3,-1,"In addition to that, the adversarial relationship between ourselves and the Soviet Union would undoubtedly deteriorate very rapidly."
15194,-3,-1,"This attitude is extremely dangerous and belligerent in its tone, although it's said with a quiet voice."
15196,-3,-1,"I know the President's supposed to be replying to me, but sometimes, I have a hard time in connecting what he's saying, with what I have said or what my positions are."
15199,-3,-1,"It calls for a mutual reduction of these weapons, as I say, that neither of us can represent a threat to the other."
15202,-3,-1,And I think our allies would be very happy to go along with a fair and verifiable SALT agreement.
15204,-3,-1,"I think, to close out this discussion, it would be better to put into perspective what we're talking about."
15205,-3,0,"I had a discussion with my daughter, Amy, the other day, before I came here, to ask her what the most important issue was."
15207,-3,-1,This is a formidable force.
15208,-3,1,Some of these weapons have 10 megatons of explosion.
15209,-3,1,"If you put 50 tons of TNT in each one of railroad cars, you would have a carload of TNT - a trainload of TNT stretching across this nation."
15210,-3,-1,That's one major war explosion in a warhead.
15211,-3,1,"We have thousands, equivalent of megaton, or million tons, of TNT warheads."
15212,-3,-1,"The control of these weapons is the single major responsibility of a President, and to cast out this commitment of all Presidents, because of some slight technicalities that can be corrected, is a very dangerous approach."
15218,-3,-1,"I don't think there's any doubt that, in the future, the cost of oil is going to go up."
15220,-3,-1,"It can only be done in two ways: one, to conserve energy - to stop the waste of energy - and, secondly, to produce more American energy."
15223,-3,1,We imported today 2 million barrels of oil less than we did the same date just a year ago.
15224,-3,-1,"This commitment has been opening up a very bright vista for our nation in the future, because with the windfall profits tax as a base, we now have an opportunity to use American technology and American ability and American natural resources to expand rapidly the production of synthetic fuels, yes; to expand rapidly the production of solar energy, yes; and also to produce the traditional kinds of American energy."
15227,-3,1,We are exporting more coal this year than any year in history.
15229,-3,-1,"This exciting future will not only give us more energy security, but will also open up vast opportunities for Americans to live a better life and to have millions of new jobs associated with this new and very dynamic industry now in prospect because of the new energy policy that we've put into effect."
15236,-3,1,"The coal that the President mentioned - yes, we have it - and yet one-eighth of our total coal resources is not being utilized at all right now."
15237,-3,1,The mines are closed down; there are 22000 miners out of work.
15240,-3,-1,"I think, as technology improves, we'll be able to do even better with that."
15241,-3,1,"The other thing is that we have only leased out - begun to explore - 2% of our outer continental shelf for oil, where it is believed, by everyone familiar with that fuel and that source of energy, that there are vast supplies yet to be found."
15245,-3,1,Nuclear power: There were 36 power plants planned in this country.
15246,-3,-1,And let me add the word safety; it must be done with the utmost of safety.
15247,-3,1,"But 32 of those have given up and canceled their plans to build, and again, because Government regulations and permits, and so forth, take - make it take - more than twice as long to build a nuclear plant in the United States as it does to build one in Japan or in Western Europe."
15251,-3,-1,"To repeat myself, we have this year the opportunity, which we'll realize, to produce 800 million tons of coal - an unequaled record in the history of our country."
15253,-3,-1,We cannot cast aside these regulations.
15254,-3,-1,"We have a chance in the next 15 years, insisting upon the health and safety of workers in the mines, and also preserving the same high air and water pollution standards, to triple the amount of coal we produce."
15255,-3,1,"Governor Reagan's approach to our energy policy, which has already proven its effectiveness, is to repeal, or to change substantially, the windfall profits tax - to return a major portion of $227 billion back to the oil companies; to do away with the Department of Energy; to short-circuit our synthetic fuels program; to put a minimal emphasis on solar power; to emphasize strongly nuclear power plants as a major source of energy in the future."
15256,-3,-1,He wants to put all our eggs in one basket and give that basket to the major oil companies.
15258,-3,-1,"That is a misstatement, of course, of my position."
15260,-3,1,The Department of Energy has a multi-billion-dollar budget in excess of $10 billion.
15262,-3,-1,"And for Mr. Carter to suggest that I want to do away with the safety laws and with the laws that pertain to clean water and clean air, and so forth."
15263,-3,1,"As Governor of California, I took charge of passing the strictest air pollution laws in the United States - the strictest air quality law that has even been adopted in the United States."
15267,-3,1,"I am suggesting that there are literally thousands of unnecessary regulations that invade every facet of business, and indeed, very much of our personal lives, that are unnecessary; that Government can do without; that have added $130 billion to the cost of production in this country; and that are contributing their part to inflation."
15268,-3,-1,"And I would like to see us a little more free, as we once were."
15271,-3,-1,"As a matter of fact,."
15272,-3,1,"the air pollution standard laws that were passed in California were passed over the objections of Governor Reagan, and this is a very well-known fact."
15276,-3,1,"We have, with our five-year plan for the leasing of offshore lands, proposed more land to be drilled than has been opened up for drilling since this program first started in 1954."
15277,-3,-1,"So we're not putting restraints on American exploration, we're encouraging it in every way we can."
15280,-3,1,"If it is a well-known fact that I opposed air pollution laws in California, the only thing I can possibly think of is that the President must be suggesting the law that the Federal Government tried to impose on the State of California - not a law, but regulations - that would have made it impossible to drive an automobile within the city limits of any California city, or to have a place to put it if you did drive it against their regulations."
15283,-3,1,"As for offshore oiling, only 2% now is so leased and is producing oil."
15284,-3,-1,"The rest, as to whether the lands are going to be opened in the next five years or so - we're already five years behind in what we should be doing."
15285,-3,1,"There is more oil now, in the wells that have been drilled, than has been taken out in 121 years that they've been drilled."
15294,-3,1,"Now, it is trillions of dollars out of balance, and the only answer that has come so far is the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history - the payroll tax increase for Social Security - which will only put a band-aid on this and postpone the day of reckoning by a few years at most."
15295,-3,-1,"What is needed is a study that I have proposed by a task force of experts to look into this entire problem as to how it can be reformed and made actuarially sound, but with the premise that no one presently dependent on Social Security is going to have the rug pulled out from under them and not get their check."
15296,-3,-1,"We cannot frighten, as we have with the threats and the campaign rhetoric that has gone on in this campaign, our senior citizens - leave them thinking that in some way, they're endangered and they would have no place to turn."
15297,-3,-1,"They must continue to get those checks, and I believe that the system can be put on a sound actuarial basis."
15298,-3,-1,"But it's going to take some study and some work, and not just passing a tax increase to let the load - or the roof - fall in on the next administration."
15304,-3,-1,"As long as there is a Democratic President in the White House, we will have a strong and viable Social Security System, free of the threat of bankruptcy."
15305,-3,1,"Although Governor Reagan has changed his position lately, on four different occasions, he has advocated making Social Security a voluntary system, which would, in effect, very quickly bankrupt it."
15307,-3,-1,"These kinds of approaches are very dangerous to the security, the well being and the peace of mind of the retired people of this country and those approaching retirement age."
15308,-3,-1,"But no matter what it takes in the future to keep Social Security sound, it must be kept that way."
15310,-3,-1,That is the way it will stay.
15312,-3,-1,"Well, that just isn't true."
15314,-3,-1,"Now, again this statement that somehow, I wanted to destroy it and I just changed my tune, that I am for voluntary Social Security, which would mean the ruin of it."
15317,-3,-1,That is the closest I have ever come to anything voluntary with Social Security.
15320,-3,-1,"I would like to make a change in the regulation that discriminates against a wife who works and finds that she then is faced with a choice between her father's or her husband's benefits, if he dies first, or what she has paid in; but it does not recognize that she has also been paying in herself, and she is entitled to more than she presently can get."
15321,-3,-1,I'd like to change that.
15323,-3,-1,These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country.
15324,-3,-1,"It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people."
15325,-3,-1,"We also need to continue to index Social Security payments, so that if inflation rises, the Social Security payments would rise a commensurate degree to let the buying power of a Social Security check continue intact."
15326,-3,-1,"In the past, the relationship between Social Security and Medicare has been very important to providing some modicum of aid for senior citizens in the retention of health benefits."
15327,-3,1,"Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare."
15328,-3,-1,"Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it."
15329,-3,-1,"These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people."
15330,-3,-1,"Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal."
15333,-3,-1,I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed.
15336,-3,-1,There is something else about Social Security.
15339,-3,1,"I think it is disgraceful that the Disability Insurance Fund in Social Security finds checks going every month to tens of thousands of people who are locked up in our institutions for crime or for mental illness, and they are receiving disability checks from Social Security every month while a state institution provides for all of their needs and their care."
15341,-3,-1,"I think this debate on Social Security, Medicare, national health insurance typifies, as vividly any other subject tonight, the basic historical differences between the Democratic Party and Republican Party."
15342,-3,-1,"The allusions to basic changes in the minimum wage is another, and the deleterious comments that Governor Reagan has made about unemployment compensation."
15343,-3,-1,These commitments that the Democratic Party has historically made to the working families of this nation have been extremely important to the growth in their stature and in a better quality of life for them.
15346,-3,-1,"So, it is good fo the American people to remember that there is a sharp basic historical difference between Governor Reagan and me on these crucial issues - also, between the two parties that we represent."
15353,-3,-1,"Barbara, reluctant as I am to say anything critical about Governor Reagan, I will try to answer your question."
15354,-3,-1,"First of all, there is the historical perspective that I just described."
15355,-3,-1,"This is a contest between a Democrat in the mainstream of my party, as exemplified by the actions that I have taken in the Oval Office the last four years, as contrasted with Governor Reagan, who in most cases does typify his party, but in some cases, there is a radical departure by him from the heritage of Eisenhower and others."
15356,-3,-1,"The most important crucial difference in this election campaign, in my judgment, is the approach to the control of nuclear weaponry and the inclination to control or not to control the spread of atomic weapons to other nations who don't presently have it, particularly terrorist nations."
15358,-3,-1,"This is typical of his long-standing inclination, on the use of American power, not to resolve disputes diplomatically and peacefully, but to show that the exercise of military power is best proven by the actual use of it."
15359,-3,-1,"Obviously, no President wants war, and I certainly do not believe that Governor Reagan, if he were President, would want war, but a President in the Oval Office has to make a judgment on almost a daily basis about how to exercise the enormous power of our country for peace, through diplomacy, or in a careless way in a belligerent attitude which has exemplified his attitudes in the past."
15365,-3,-1,"It has imposed on the individual freedoms of the people, and there are more of these things that could be solved by the people themselves, if they were given a chance, or by the levels of government that were closer to them."
15367,-3,1,"He added the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation, and it came, at that time, to 12.5% under President Ford."
15369,-3,1,"Today, by his own decision, the misery index is in excess of 20%, and I think this must suggest something."
15370,-3,0,"But, when I had quoted a Democratic President, as the President says, I was a Democrat."
15371,-3,-1,I said many foolish things back in those days.
15372,-3,-1,"But the President that I quoted had made a promise, a Democratic promise, and I quoted him because it was never kept."
15373,-3,-1,"And today, you would find that that promise is at the very heart of what Republicanism represents in this country today."
15374,-3,-1,"That's why I believe there are going to be millions of Democrats that are going to vote with us this time around, because they too want that promise kept."
15378,-3,-1,I don't think that can be better illustrated than in the case of guaranteeing women equal rights under the Constitution of our nation.
15381,-3,-1,Governor Reagan and his new Republican Party have departed from this commitment - a very severe blow to the opportunity for women to finally correct discrimination under which they have suffered.
15382,-3,1,"When a man and a women do the same amount of work, a man gets paid $1.00, a women only gets paid 59 cents."
15384,-3,-1,"That is all it says a simple guarantee of equality of opportunity which typifies the Democratic arty, and which is a very important commitment of mine, as contrasted with Governor Reagan's radical departure from the long-standing policy of his own party."
15387,-3,-1,"Mr. President, once again, I happen to be against the amendment, because I think the amendment will take this problem out of the hands of elected legislators and put it in the hands f unelected judges."
15389,-3,1,"While I was Governor, more than eight years ago, I found 14 separate instances where women were discriminated against in the body of California law, and I had passed and signed into law 14 statutes that eliminated those discriminations, including the economic ones that you have just mentioned - equal pay and so forth."
15391,-3,-1,"If I were President, I would also now take a look at the hundreds of Federal regulations which discriminate against women and which go right on while everyone is looking for an amendment."
15392,-3,-1,"I would have someone ride herd on those regulations, and we would start eliminating those discriminations in the Federal Government against women."
15394,-3,0,"Howard, I'm a Southerner, and I share the basic beliefs of my region that an excessive government intrusion into the private affairs of American citizens and also into the private affairs of the free enterprise system."
15401,-3,-1,It is part of my consciousness and of my commitment to continue this progress.
15402,-3,0,"So, my heritage as a Southerner, my experience in the Oval Office, convinces me that what I have just described is a proper course for the future."
15404,-3,-1,"Well, my last word is again to say this: We were talking about this very simple amendment and women's rights."
15405,-3,-1,And I make it plain again: I am for women's rights.
15407,-3,-1,"Those would all, could all be challenged by men."
15408,-3,-1,And the same would be true with regard to combat service in the military and so forth.
15410,-3,1,"But, if we're talking about how much we think about the working people and so forth, I'm the only fellow who ever ran for this job who was six times President of his own union and still has a lifetime membership in that union."
15413,-3,-1,"First of all, I'd like to thank the League of Women Voters for making this debate possible."
15414,-3,-1,I think it's been a very constructive debate and I hope it's helped to acquaint the American people with the sharp differences between myself and Governor Reagan.
15415,-3,-1,"Also, I want to thank the people of Cleveland and Ohio for being such hospitable hosts during these last few hours in my life."
15420,-3,-1,"As I've studied the record between myself and Governor Reagan, I've been impressed with the stark differences that exist between us."
15421,-3,-1,I think the result of this debate indicates that that fact is true.
15423,-3,-1,I consider myself in the mainstream even of the bipartisan list of Presidents who served before me.
15424,-3,-1,The United States must be a nation strong; the United States must be a nation secure.
15425,-3,-1,We must have a society that's just and fair.
15428,-3,-1,"In each case, I alone have had to determine the interests of my country and the degree of involvement of my country."
15429,-3,-1,"I've done that with moderation, with care, with thoughtfulness; sometimes consulting experts."
15430,-3,-1,"But, I've learned in this last three and a half years that when an issue is extremely difficult, when the call is very close, the chances are the experts will be divided almost 50-50."
15431,-3,-1,"And the final judgment about the future of the nation - war, peace, involvement, reticence, thoughtfulness, care, consideration, concern - has to be made by the man in the Oval Office."
15432,-3,-1,"It's a lonely job, but with the involvement of the American people in the process, with an open Government, the job is a very gratifying one."
15434,-3,-1,Those listening to my voice will have to make a judgment about the future of this country.
15435,-3,-1,And I think they ought to remember that one vote can make a lot of difference.
15438,-3,-1,There is a partnership involved in our nation.
15439,-3,-1,"To stay strong, to stay at peace, to raise high the banner of human rights, to set an example for the rest of the world, to let our deep beliefs and commitments be felt by others in other nations, is my plan for the future."
15447,-3,-1,"I think when you make that decision, it might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than you were four years ago?"
15448,-3,-1,Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago?
15449,-3,-1,Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?
15450,-3,-1,Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?
15452,-3,-1,"And if you answer all of those questions yes, why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for."
15454,-3,-1,This country doesn't have to be in the shape that it is in.
15455,-3,-1,"We do not have to go on sharing in scarcity with the country getting worse off, with unemployment growing."
15456,-3,-1,We talk about the unemployment lines.
15458,-3,-1,All of this can be cured and all of it can be solved.
15459,-3,1,"I have not had the experience the President has had in holding that office, but I think in being Governor of California, the most populous state in the Union - if it were a nation, it would be the seventh-ranking economic power in the world - I, too, had some lonely moments and decisions to make."
15463,-3,1,"We returned $5.7 billion in tax rebates, credits and cuts to our people."
15464,-3,1,"We, as I have said earlier, fell below the national average in inflation when we did that."
15466,-3,-1,"I would like to have a crusade today, and I would like to lead that crusade with your help."
15467,-3,-1,"And it would be one to take Government off the backs of the great people of this country, and turn you loose again to do those things that I know you can do so well, because you did them and made this country great."
15483,-3,1,And I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life.
15484,-3,-1,"I don't see any evidence that it's a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime."
15487,-3,-1,But we have work to do in this nation.
15488,-3,-1,"We have work to do to fight a real war, not a phony war, against drugs."
15489,-3,-1,"And that's something I want to lead, something we haven't had over the course of the past many years, even though the Vice President has been at least allegedly in charge of that war."
15490,-3,-1,"We have much to do to step up that war, to double the number of drug enforcement agents, to fight both here and abroad, to work with our neighbors in this hemisphere."
15492,-3,-1,But we also have to deal with drug education prevention here at home.
15493,-3,-1,And that's one of the things that I hope I can lead personally as the President of the United States.
15499,-3,-1,"Well, a lot of what this campaign is about, it seems to me Bernie, goes to the question of values."
15501,-3,-1,"You see, I do believe that some crimes are so heinous, so brutal, so outrageous, and I'd say particularly those that result in the death of a police officer, for those real brutal crimes, I do believe in the death penalty, and I think it is a deterrent, and I believe we need it."
15502,-3,-1,And I'm glad that the Congress moved on this drug bill and have finally called for that related to these narcotics drug kingpins.
15510,-3,-1,I'd have confidence in him.
15511,-3,-1,And I made a good selection.
15512,-3,-1,"And I've never seen such a pounding, an unfair pounding, on a young Senator in my entire life."
15516,-3,0,He had two terms in the Congress.
15517,-3,1,"He had two terms in the Senate, serving his second term."
15518,-3,1,"He founded authored, the job training partnership act."
15520,-3,-1,"We're moving into a new competitive age, and we need that kind of thing."
15521,-3,1,"He, unlike my opponent, is an expert in national defense; helped amend the INF treaty so we got a good, sound treaty, when these people over here were talking about a freeze."
15522,-3,-1,"If we'd listened to them, we would never have had a treaty."
15526,-3,-1,They don't like it when there's an unfair pounding and kind of hooting about people.
15528,-3,-1,And so I'm proud of my choice.
15529,-3,-1,"And you know, I don't think age is the only criterion."
15531,-3,-1,I made a good selection.
15532,-3,-1,"The American people are seeing it, and I'm proud of it; that's what I'd say."
15537,-3,-1,And that's why people are so concerned.
15538,-3,-1,Because it was an opportunity for us to demonstrate what we were looking for in a running mate.
15540,-3,0,The Vice President talks about national security.
15554,-3,1,"And the main point is, taxes have been cut, and yet income is up to the Federal Government by 25 percent in the last three years."
15555,-3,-1,And so what I want to do is keep this expansion going.
15556,-3,-1,I don't want to kill it off by a tax increase.
15557,-3,1,"More Americans at work today than at any time in the history of the country, and a greater percentage of the work force."
15558,-3,-1,And the way you kill expansions is to raise taxes.
15560,-3,-1,And what I have proposed is something much better.
15562,-3,-1,And that is what I call a flexible freeze that allows growth about 4 percent or the rate of inflation but does not permit the Congress just to add on spending.
15569,-3,-1,So I'm pledged to do that.
15574,-3,1,He's broken it three times in the past year already.
15575,-3,-1,So it isn't worth the paper it's printed on.
15581,-3,-1,"No, we need a chief executive who is prepared to lead; who won't blame the Congress; who will lead to bring down that deficit, who will make tough choices on spending"
15589,-3,-1,There is no way of anticipating what may happen.
15590,-3,-1,"I will say this: that we will set as our goal a steady, gradual reduction of the deficit, which will require tough choices on spending; it will require a good strong rate of economic growth; it will require a plan that the president works out with the Congress doesn't blame them, works it out with them, which brings that deficit down; it will require us to go out and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren't being paid in this country."
15591,-3,-1,And that's grossly unfair to the average American who is paying his taxes and paying them on time and doesn't have any alternative: it's taken out of his paycheck.
15593,-3,-1,That's not what we are going to do.
15596,-3,-1,"Now, I think if we work together on it, and if you have a president that will work with the Congress and the American people, we can bring that deficit down steadily, $20, $25, $30 billion a year, build economic growth, build a good strong future for America, invest in those things which we must invest in economic development, good jobs, good schools for our kids, college opportunity for young people, decent health care and affordable housing, and a clean and safe environment."
15599,-3,-1,But sooner or later that credit card mentality isn't going to work.
15600,-3,-1,"And I want to bring to the White House a sense of strength and fiscal responsibility which will build a good strong foundation under which this country, or above which country can move, grow, invest, and build the best America for its people and for our kids and our grandkids."
15604,-3,-1,"I wish he would join me, as a matter of fact, in appealing to the American people for the balanced budget amendment for the federal government and for the line-item veto."
15605,-3,-1,"(Applause) I'd like to have that line-item veto for the president, because I think that would be extraordinarily helpful."
15606,-3,1,And I won't do one other thing that he's had to do: took $29 million out of his state pension fund that's equivalent at the federal level of taking out of the Social Security trust fund.
15610,-3,-1,"And this idea of unleashing a whole bunch-an army, a conventional force army, of IRS agents into everybody's kitchen I mean, he's against most defense matters, and now he wants to get an army of JRS auditors going out there."
15621,-3,-1,I don't know if the vice president agrees with that.
15627,-3,0,"(Applause) I have been in politics for twenty-five years, Margaret; I've won a lot of elections, I've lost a few, as you know, and learned from those losses."
15628,-3,0,I won the Democratic nomination in fifty-one separate contests.
15629,-3,-1,I think I'm a reasonably likable guy.
15630,-3,-1,"(Laughter, scattered applause) I'm serious though I think I'm a little more lovable these days than I used to be back in my youth when I began in my state legislature."
15631,-3,-1,But I'm also a serious guy.
15634,-3,-1,(Laughter) But I also think it's important to be somebody who is willing to make those tough choices.
15637,-3,1,"And you supported legislation this year that's involved tax increases not once, but twice."
15639,-3,-1,"The fact of the matter is that the next president of the United States is going to have to go to the White House seriously, he is going to have to work with the Congress seriously he can't turn to the Congress and blame them for the fact that we don't have a balanced budget and that we have billions and billions of dollars in red ink."
15642,-3,-1,"And I think we know what they are: a good strong future, a future in which there is opportunity for all of our citizens."
15644,-3,-1,I don't think it's a question of whether people like you or not to make you an effective leader.
15647,-3,-1,You've got to understand that it is only the United States that can stand for freedom and democracy around the world and we can't turn it over to the United Nations or other multilateral organizations.
15649,-3,-1,"And I know these campaigns get knocked a lot, but I think I'd be a better President now for having had to travel to these communities and understand the family values and the importance of neighborhood."
15662,-3,-1,"And then at that Democratic convention, they made a determination and they said there, ideology doesn't matter, just competence."
15664,-3,0,It wasn't me that was there at that convention.
15665,-3,-1,Thank God I was up in the with Jimmy Baker camping out and I didn't have to hear all the personal attacks on me out of that Democratic convention.
15668,-3,-1,"But I have defined the issues and I am not going to let Governor Dukakis go through this election without explaining some of these very liberal position he's the one a liberal, traditional liberal a progressive liberal Democrat."
15670,-3,-1,And I have enormous difference with the ACLU on their politic agenda.
15683,-3,-1,And we have two fundamentally different visions of America.
15684,-3,-1,"The Vice President is complacent, thinks we ought to stick with the status quo, doesn't think we ought to move ahead, thinking things are okay as they are."
15687,-3,-1,We've always been a nation which was ambitious for America and we move forward.
15688,-3,-1,And that's the kind of America I want.
15691,-3,-1,There's nothing the matter with that.
15692,-3,-1,But let's stop labeling each other and lets' get to the heart of the matter which is the future of this country.
15702,-3,-1,"If I knew of three new weapons systems that I thought were purely waste and weren't protected by the Congress, they wouldn't be in the budget."
15703,-3,-1,"They would not be in the budget, but you want one now?"
15704,-3,1,"I'll give you one, that HMET, that heavy truck, that's cost what is it $850 million and the Pentagon didn't request it and, yet, a member of Congress, a very powerful one, put it in the budget."
15706,-3,-1,"It is new and it is very very different than what's happened, but it's not quite ready to be totally implemented."
15712,-3,1,We're in the serious stages of negotiation with the Soviet Union on the strategic arms control talks.
15713,-3,-1,And we're protecting a couple of options in terms of modernizing our strategic forces.
15716,-3,-1,"We are moving forward with negotiations and, you see, I just think it would be dumb negotiating policy with the Soviets to cut out one or the other of the two options right now."
15721,-3,-1,"And, so, that's the way I'd reply to it and I believe we can have the strongest and best defense possible if we modernize, if we go forward with competitive strategies and if we do follow through on the Packard Commission report."
15723,-3,-1,"Well, Andrea, we've just had another example of why the Vice President's mathematics just don't add up."
15725,-3,-1,Everybody knows that including the people at the Pentagon.
15728,-3,1,"We're not going to spend billions on MX's on railroad cars, which is a weapons system we don't need, can't afford and won't help our defense posture at all."
15729,-3,-1,We're not going to spend hundreds of millions on a space plane from Washington to Tokyo.
15732,-3,-1,We're going to go forward with the Stealth and the D-5 and the advance cruise missile and good conventional forces.
15733,-3,-1,But the next President of the United States will have to make some tough and difficult decisions.
15734,-3,-1,"I'm prepared to make them, the Vice President is not."
15742,-3,1,"Well, Andrea, today we have 13,000 strategic nuclear warheads, on land, on air and in the sea."
15743,-3,-1,That's an incredibly powerful nuclear deterrent.
15746,-3,-1,There are limits to this nation's ability to finance these weapons systems.
15748,-3,-1,How can we build a strong America militarily that's teeter-tottering on a mountain of debt?
15749,-3,-1,"And if we go forward with the kinds of policies that the Vice President is suggesting tonight and has in the past, that debt is going to grow bigger and bigger and bigger."
15753,-3,-1,"And we have serious problems with our conventional forces at the present time, and they'll get worse unless we have a president who is willing to make some of these decisions."
15754,-3,-1,"And we also have important domestic priorities, in education and housing and health care, in economic development, in job training, in the environment."
15755,-3,-1,And all of these things are going to have to be addressed.
15757,-3,-1,I want the men and women of our Armed Forces to have the support they need to defend us; the support they need when they risk our lives to keep us free and to keep this country free.
15758,-3,-1,But we cannot continue to live on a credit card.
15760,-3,-1,And that's the kind of America I want to build.
15766,-3,-1,I think the foremost responsibility of a president really gets down to the national security of this country.
15772,-3,1,"And the result is, we deployed, and the Soviets kept deploying, and then we negotiated from strength."
15773,-3,1,And now we have the first arms control agreement in the nuclear age to ban weapons.
15774,-3,-1,You just don't make unilateral cuts in the naive hope that the Soviets are going to behave themselves.
15776,-3,-1,And I'm proud to have been a part of an administration that has done exactly that.
15784,-3,-1,"Well, I think when I think of heroes, I think back, not presently, Ann."
15785,-3,-1,But there are many people who I admire in this country today.
15786,-3,-1,"Some of them are in public life in the Senate, the Congress."
15790,-3,-1,"We felt strongly about them, and they did so well by us."
15791,-3,0,"I can think of doctors and scientists, Jonas Salk who for example discovered a vaccine which cured one of the most dread diseases we ever had."
15793,-3,-1,"I think of classroom teachers, classroom teachers that I have had, classroom teachers that youngsters have today who are real heroes to our young people."
15797,-3,-1,Members of the clergy who have done the same.
15798,-3,0,"Drug counselors out there in the street who are providing help to youngsters who come up to me and others who ask for help and want help, are doing the hard work, the heroic work, which it takes to provide that kind of leadership, that kind of counseling, that kind of support."
15799,-3,-1,"I think of people in the law enforcement community who are taking their lives in their hands everyday, when they go up to one of those doors and kick it down and try to stop this flow of drugs into our communities and into our kids."
15802,-3,-1,"In many cases they are people in the community who are examples, and are role models."
15803,-3,-1,"And I would hope that one of the things I could do as president is to recognize them, to give them the kind of recognition that they need and deserve so that more and more young people can themselves become the heroes of tomorrow, can go into public service, can go into teaching, can go into drug counseling, can go into law enforcement, and be heroes themselves to generations yet to come."
15806,-3,0,"I think of a young man now in this country named Villadaris, who was released from a Cuban jail."
15809,-3,-1,I agree with the Governor on athletics.
15811,-3,-1,I think of Dr. Fauci.
15812,-3,-1,Probably never heard of him.
15813,-3,-1,"You did, Ann heard of him."
15815,-3,-1,"But look, I also think we ought to give a little credit to the President of the United States."
15816,-3,1,He is the one who has gotten us that first arms control agreement.
15821,-3,-1,"say, he is our hero."
15831,-3,-1,"No, let me tell you something about that."
15832,-3,0,And Barbara and I were sitting there before that Democratic convention.
15833,-3,0,"And we saw the Governor and his son on television the night before and his family, and his mother who was there."
15835,-3,-1,"You all know me, and we've held it back a little."
15837,-3,-1,And we've got a strong family.
15841,-3,-1,"You see our five kids, all over this country, and their spouses."
15843,-3,-1,"And I would say, I don't know whether that's kind or not, it's just an objective statement."
15844,-3,-1,I think the man anybody that gets into this political arena and has to face you guys everyday deserves a word of praise.
15845,-3,-1,Because it's gotten a little ugly out there.
15846,-3,-1,It's gotten a little nasty.
15847,-3,-1,It's not much fun sometimes.
15848,-3,-1,And I would cite again Dan Quayle.
15849,-3,-1,"I've been in politics a long time, and I don't remember that kind of piling on, that kind of ugly rumor that never was true, printed."
15852,-3,-1,But he's in the arena.
15853,-3,0,"Teddy Roosevelt used to talk about the arena, you know, daring to fail greatly or succeed, no matter."
15855,-3,-1,So I salute these things.
15858,-3,-1,He said here were all these intellectuals out there griping and complaining and saying it was negative coverage.
15859,-3,0,"Rayburn says, yeah, and that guy never ran for sheriff either."
15860,-3,0,"Michael Dukakis has run for sheriff, and so has George Bush."
15863,-3,-1,I thank you for that.
15866,-3,0,"And doesn't that prove the point, George, which is that values like family and education and community, decent homes for young people that family on Long Island I visited on Monday where Lou and Betty Tolamo (phonetic) bought a house for some $19,000 back in 1962, have had seven children, they're all making good livings."
15870,-3,-1,I think you believe in them.
15873,-3,-1,"I guess the one thing that concerns me about this, Ann, is this attempt to label things which all of us believe in."
15875,-3,-1,We may think that you deal with them in different ways.
15882,-3,-1,I think the American people would appreciate that.
15888,-3,-1,"Because you left out one other exception, the health of the mother."
15889,-3,-1,Let me answer your question and I hope it doesn't get too personal or maudlin.
15890,-3,0,"Barb and I lost a child, you know that we lost a daughter, Robin."
15893,-3,0,"He said, no, she has leukemia, acute leukemia, a few weeks to live."
15894,-3,0,We took the child to New York.
15895,-3,0,"Thanks to the miraculous sacrifice of doctors and nurses, the child stayed alive for six months and then died."
15896,-3,-1,"If that child were here today, and I was told the same thing, my granddaughter, Noel for example that child could stay alive for ten or fifteen years, or maybe for the rest of her life."
15897,-3,-1,And so I don't think that you make an exception based on medical knowledge at the time.
15899,-3,-1,"And, look, this hasn't been an easy decision for me to meet."
15901,-3,0,"But when I was in that little church across the river from Washington and saw our grandchild christened in our faith, I was very pleased indeed that the mother had not aborted that child, and put the child up for adoption."
15902,-3,-1,And so I just feel this is where I'm coming from.
15904,-3,-1,"And I don't assail him on that issue, or others on that issue."
15908,-3,0,"Margaret, Kitty and I had very much the same kind of experience that the Bushes had: we lost a baby, lived about twenty minutes after it was born."
15909,-3,-1,"But isn't the real question that we have to answer not how many exceptions we make, because the vice president himself is prepared to make exceptions."
15910,-3,-1,"It's who makes the decision, who makes this very difficult, very wrenching decision?"
15911,-3,-1,"(Applause) And I think it has to be the woman, in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs, that makes that decision."
15912,-3,-1,"Who are we to say, well, under certain circumstances, it's all right, but under other circumstances it isn't?"
15923,-3,-1,"No, I don't happen to share that goal."
15926,-3,-1,And that really is going to be a challenge for the next president of the United States; I don't think there's any question about it.
15928,-3,0,"And if we can do that and do it in a way that gets deeper cuts on the Soviet side, which is where they ought to come from, then I think we have an opportunity over the long haul to begin to move some of our resources from the military to important domestic priorities that can provide college opportunity for that young woman whose mother wrote me from Texas just the other day, from Longview, Texas: two teachers, a mother and a father who have a child that's a freshman in college, an electrical engineering major, a very bright student and they can't afford to keep that child in college."
15935,-3,-1,This is a big question.
15936,-3,-1,And it's a question as to whether the United States will continue to lead for peace.
15940,-3,-1,"So, what I'm saying is, we are going to have to make choices."
15942,-3,-1,"But while the President is negotiating with the Soviet Union, I simply do not want to make these unilateral cuts."
15943,-3,-1,And I think those that advocated the freeze missed the point that there was a better way and that better way has resulted in a principle asymmetrical cuts.
15944,-3,-1,The Soviets take out more than we do and the principle of intrusive verification.
15945,-3,-1,"And those two principles can now be applied to conventional forces, to strategic forces, provided"
15953,-3,-1,"And some domestic programs as well, Andrea."
15964,-3,1,But it's the Internal Revenue Service which estimates now that we aren't collecting $100 billion or more in taxes owed in this country.
15965,-3,-1,And that is just absolutely unfair to the vast majority of Americans who pay their taxes and pay them on time.
15967,-3,1,"It was a bipartisan commission, a study by two respected economists, which indicated that we could collect some 40, 45, 50 billion dollars of those funds."
15968,-3,-1,"The point is you've got to have a president who's prepared to do this and to begin right away and, preferably, a president who was a governor of a state that's had very, very successful experience at doing this."
15972,-3,-1,And we've had great success at revenue enforcement.
15973,-3,-1,"Now, the Vice President will probably tell you that it's going to take an army of IRS collectors again."
15975,-3,-1,"But, the fact of the matter is that this is something that we must begin it's going to take at least the first year of the new administration."
15976,-3,1,"But, the Dorgan Task Force, the bipartisan task force estimated that we could collect about $35 billion in the fifth year, $105 billion over five years, the other study even more than that"
15978,-3,-1,and that's where you begin.
15980,-3,-1,"Well, Andrea, you didn't predicate that lack of economists' support for what I call a flexible freeze, because some good very good economists do support that concept."
15983,-3,-1,I am optimistic and I believe we can keep this longest expansion going.
15984,-3,-1,"I was not out there when that stock market dropped wringing my hands and saying this was the end of the world as some political leaders were, because it isn't the end of the world."
15985,-3,-1,And what we have to do is restrain the growth of spending.
15986,-3,-1,And we are doing a better job of it.
15990,-3,-1,The American working man and woman are not taxed too little.
15991,-3,-1,The Federal Government continues to spend too much.
15997,-3,-1,More so you than me.
15999,-3,-1,"No, but you got to go back to what social security was when it was created."
16000,-3,1,It wasn't created as a welfare program.
16005,-3,-1,"So, I don't want to fool around with it."
16009,-3,-1,In precinct politics in Texas and I've seen it at the national level.
16010,-3,-1,We have made the Social Security Trust Fund sound.
16011,-3,-1,And it is going to be operating at surpluses and I don't want the liberal Democratic Congress to spend out of that Social Security Trust Fund or go and take the money out for some other purpose.
16013,-3,-1,And I will not go in there and suggest changes in Social Security.
16016,-3,-1,"And I am going to keep that Social Security Trust Fund sound and keep our commitment to the elderly and maybe down the line, maybe when you get two decades or one into the next century, you're going to have to take another look at it, but not now."
16018,-3,-1,Keep the trust with the older men and women of this country.
16020,-3,-1,"Andrea, I don't know which George Bush I'm listening to."
16021,-3,1,"George Bush, a few years ago, said that Social Security was basically a welfare system."
16024,-3,1,I voted against that at the National Governors Association.
16027,-3,-1,"The reason that we raise concerns, not just in election years, but every year, because Republicans, once they're elected and start cutting."
16030,-3,-1,And I'm sure you'll try to do it again.
16031,-3,-1,Because there's no way you can finance what you want to spend.
16038,-3,-1,"I feel pretty confident tonight, but not that confident."
16040,-3,-1,"Secondly, I don't have any litmus test."
16041,-3,-1,"But what I would do is appoint people to the Federal Bench that will not legislate from the Bench, who will interpret the Constitution."
16042,-3,-1,I do not want to see us go to again and Fm using this word advisedly a liberal majority that is going to legislate from the Bench.
16052,-3,-1,If the Vice President of the United States thinks that Robert Bork was an outstanding appointment (Cheers and Applause)
16053,-3,-1,that is a very good reason for voting for Mike Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen on the 8th of November.
16057,-3,1,"I've appointed over 130, so I have a record."
16060,-3,-1,I don't ask people whether they're Republicans or Democrats.
16061,-3,0,"I've appointed prosecutors, I've appointed defenders."
16064,-3,-1,And those are the standards that I will use in nominating people to the Supreme Court of the United States.
16078,-3,-1,"Yes, we now have catastrophic health insurance, but it's going to cost, and that's going to be an additional burden on elderly citizens."
16082,-3,-1,Now there are some things we can do to help people who currently do get entitlements to get off public assistance.
16085,-3,-1,That's the way you bring a deficit down and help to improve the quality of life for people at the same time.
16088,-3,1,"But let me simply say for the record, I did not vote to cut COLAs."
16091,-3,-1,So I don't believe that we need to do what you've suggested here.
16094,-3,-1,And I have made some good sound proposals.
16096,-3,-1,"You see, I want the families to have the choice."
16097,-3,-1,I don't want to see the Federal Government licensing grandmothers.
16098,-3,-1,"I don't want to see the Federal Government saying to communities, well, you can't do this any more."
16102,-3,-1,And I want to keep it alive in child care and in other entitlements.
16109,-3,-1,That is absolutely not true.
16121,-3,-1,"But everybody knew that those of us who voted against the freezing of COLAs did so, we did so emphatically."
16123,-3,-1,"The point is that as we look at this nation's future, and we have two very different visions of this future."
16124,-3,-1,I want to move ahead.
16125,-3,0,The Vice President talks about a thousand points of light.
16126,-3,-1,I'm interested in 240 million points of light.
16127,-3,-1,"I'm interested in 240 million citizens in this country who share in the American dream, all of them in every part of this country."
16133,-3,-1,"It's a very sacred contract, and I believe in it."
16134,-3,-1,So that's not where we ought to go.
16135,-3,-1,There are plenty of places to cut.
16137,-3,-1,There are we certainly ought to be able to
16139,-3,-1,"Give our farm families a decent income with spending $20to $25 billion a year on farm subsidies, and I'm sure we can do that."
16142,-3,-1,"Well, let me take him up on this question of farm subsidies."
16143,-3,-1,"We have a fundamental difference, approach on agriculture."
16144,-3,-1,He favors this supply maintenance or production controls.
16148,-3,-1,"I think the farm bill that he criticizes was good legislation, outstanding legislation."
16149,-3,-1,"And I believe the answer to the agricultural economy is not to get the government further involved, but to do what I'm suggesting."
16151,-3,-1,We never should go back to that.
16152,-3,-1,And we ought to expand our markets abroad.
16153,-3,-1,We ought to have rural enterprise zones.
16155,-3,1,But let's not go back and keep assailing a farm bill that passed with overwhelming Democrat and Republican support.
16157,-3,1,The farm payments are going down because the agricultural economy is coming back.
16167,-3,1,90 percent reductions in lead since I chaired that regulatory task force; 90 percent.
16168,-3,-1,"It's almost you remember that expression, get the lead out?"
16173,-3,-1,But what I'm not for what I'm not for is measuring it the way that the Democratic Congress does.
16174,-3,-1,"We sent up a good bill on clean water, a sound bill on clean water."
16177,-3,0,I've been an outdoorsman and a sportsman all my life.
16178,-3,0,I've been to these national parks.
16180,-3,0,"I headed the task force when I was a member of the Congress way back in the late '60s on these kinds of things, on the Republican side."
16183,-3,-1,That is the same old argument that's gotten us into trouble on the deficit side.
16185,-3,-1,I'm not going to go down there and try to dump the sludge from Massachusetts off the beaches off of New Jersey.
16189,-3,-1,"Come on, give me five."
16190,-3,-1,"I mean, this guy, this is too much."
16191,-3,-1,But I'm not going to do that.
16195,-3,-1,"And I'll do a good job, because I am committed."
16198,-3,-1,"Margaret, I'm not sure I can get all of this in in one minute."
16199,-3,0,"George, we have supply management today under the 1985 bill."
16202,-3,-1,I'm against the grain embargo; it was a mistake.
16208,-3,1,"George, Boston Harbor was polluted for 100 years."
16228,-3,-1,The American people are up to here with debates.
16232,-3,-1,I've spelled out my position.
16234,-3,-1,But take a look at the Democratic convention take a look at it.
16241,-3,-1,"Because you are so interested in a poll that might have been coming out, or because somebody had said something nasty about somebody else."
16242,-3,-1,And so I don't know what the answer is.
16244,-3,-1,"How can Barry Goldwater sitting in Arizona know whether I'm talking on the issues or not when we put out position paper after position paper, he puts out position paper after position paper; and we see this much about it, because everyone else is fascinated with polls and who's up or down today and who's going to be up or down tomorrow."
16245,-3,-1,"So I think we can all share, with respect, in the fact that maybe the message is not getting out."
16247,-3,0,There will be no more debates.
16250,-3,-1,"I can understand, after the vice presidential debate, why Mr. Bush would want no more debates."
16252,-3,-1,"Andrea, I think we both have a responsibility to try to address the issues."
16253,-3,-1,"Yes, we have fundamental differences."
16254,-3,-1,I think a great many of them have come out today.
16255,-3,-1,"And I think if we get rid of the labels--and I'm not keeping count, but I think Mr. Bush has used the label ""liberal"" at least ten times if I had a dollar, George, for every time you used that label, I'd qualify for one of those tax breaks for the rich that you want to give away."
16259,-3,-1,"I want to move forward, I want this nation to move forward."
16261,-3,-1,I am concerned about what that does to our future.
16268,-3,-1,"I think we ought to be looking at modernization, I think we ought to be exploring less expensive ways to get it on land, and we ought to make sure that we have an effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent."
16270,-3,-1,"And every defense expert I know, including people in the Pentagon itself, will tell you that given the level of defense spending and the level of defense appropriations which the Congress has now approved and the president has signed, there's no way that you can do all of these things and do them well."
16271,-3,-1,"That's why tough choices will be required, choices I am prepared to make, Mr. Bush is not prepared to make."
16272,-3,-1,"But, Andrea, I think we can go far beyond this as well, because we have opportunities now step-by-step to bring down the level of strategic weapons, get a test ban treaty, negotiate those conventional force reductions."
16273,-3,-1,"I would challenge Mr. Gorbachev to join with us in limiting in eliminating regional conflict in the Middle East, in Central America."
16278,-3,0,"I've met with them, I know them, I've spent time in South America-speak the language, so does Senator Bentsen."
16279,-3,-1,"We want to work with them and build a new relationship, and they with us."
16282,-3,-1,Those are the kinds of priorities for national security and for foreign policy that I want to pursue Mr. Bush and I have major differences on these issues and I hope very much to be president and pursue them.
16284,-3,-1,"In terms of regional tensions, we have now gotten the attention of the Soviet Union."
16285,-3,-1,And the reason we've gotten it is because they see us now as unwilling to make the very kinds of unilateral cuts that have been called for and to go for the discredited freeze.
16287,-3,-1,"It now looks, because of steady negotiation, that we may have an agreement that will remove the Cubans from Angola."
16288,-3,-1,We see the Russians coming out of Afghanistan.
16291,-3,-1,"Those Sandinistas came in and betrayed the trust of the revolution; they said it was about democracy, and they have done nothing other than solidify their Marxist domination over that country."
16296,-3,-1,"Well, it's a great concern of mine and I think of all Americans, and perhaps the vice president can tell us what's been going on."
16298,-3,-1,"An administration which wants to billions on weapons systems that we don't need and can't afford, and now confronts us with a very serious problem, and plants that are supposed to be producing tritium and plutonium and providing the necessary materials for existing weapons."
16299,-3,-1,"Yes, if we don't do something about it, we may find ourselves unilaterally, if I may use that term, dismantling some of these weapons."
16303,-3,-1,Why have there been these safety violations?
16304,-3,-1,Why are these plants being closed down?
16309,-3,-1,"And that's something which will be a priority of ours in the new administration because without it, we cannot have the effective and strong and credible nuclear deterrent we must have."
16311,-3,-1,"That is the closest I have ever heard the Governor of Massachusetts come to support anything having to do with nuclear, that's about as close as I've ever heard him Yes, this Savannah River plant needs to be made more safe."
16312,-3,-1,Will he join me in suggesting that we may need another plant?
16317,-3,-1,"I believe that the more dependent we become on foreign oil, the less our national security is enhanced."
16322,-3,-1,and must do what he's talking about now.
16328,-3,-1,"Yes, and I'll apply it to Congress too."
16336,-3,-1,"And yet this man, the governor, equated the President to a rotting fish."
16342,-3,-1,"But there is no corner on this sleaze factor, believe me."
16343,-3,-1,"And it's a disgrace, and I will do my level best to clean it up, recognizing that you can't legislate morality."
16344,-3,-1,"But I do believe that with my record in Congress, having led the new Congressmen to a code of ethics through major main emphasis on it in full disclosure, that I've got a good record."
16346,-3,-1,And so it isn't one and state governments have had a tough time.
16347,-3,-1,His some of his college presidents aren't exactly holier than thou.
16348,-3,-1,So let's not be throwing stones about it.
16349,-3,-1,"Let's say, this isn't Democrat or Republican, and it isn't liberal or conservative."
16350,-3,-1,Let's vow to work together to do something about it.
16352,-3,-1,And I would agree that integrity is not a Republican or a Democratic issue; it's an American issue.
16358,-3,-1,This isn't the kind of Administration we need.
16359,-3,-1,"And one of the reasons our selection of a running mate is so important, it is such a test of the kinds of standards we'll set, is because it tells the American people in advance of the election just what kind of people we're looking for."
16361,-3,0,Mr. Bush picked Dan Quayle.
16368,-3,0,"28 years ago, as a young man just graduated from law school, I came to this city, came clear across the country, to watch John Kennedy be nominated for the presidency of the United States, right here in Los Angeles."
16369,-3,-1,I never dreamed that some day I would win that nomination and be my party's nominee for president.
16371,-3,-1,That's why I'm proud and grateful to be a citizen of this country.
16376,-3,-1,They say we should be satisfied.
16377,-3,1,"But I don't think we can be satisfied when we're spending $150 billion a year in interest alone on the national debt, much of it going to foreign bankers; or when 25 percent of our high school students are dropping out of school; or when we have 2-1/2 million of our fellow citizens, a third of them veterans, who are homeless and living on streets and in doorways in this country, when Mr. Bush's prescription for our economic future is another tax giveaway to the rich."
16378,-3,-1,We can do better than that.
16379,-3,-1,"Not working with government alone, but all of us working together."
16381,-3,-1,"And we ask you for our hand for your hands and your hearts, and your votes on the 8th of November so we can move forward in the future."
16382,-3,-1,Kitty and I are very grateful to all of you for the warmth and the hospitality that you've given to us in your homes and communities all across this country.
16383,-3,-1,"We love you, and we're grateful to you for everything that you've given to us."
16384,-3,-1,And we hope that we'll be serving you in the White House in January of 1989.
16385,-3,-1,"Thank you, and God bless you."
16393,-3,-1,Because I mean it when I say I want a kinder and gentler nation.
16394,-3,-1,"And by that I want to have child care where the families, the parents, have control."
16395,-3,-1,"I want to keep our neighborhoods much, much better in terms of anti-crime, and that's why I would appoint judges that have a little more sympathy for the victims of crime and a little less for the criminals."
16396,-3,-1,That's why I do feel if some police officer is gunned down that the death penalty is required.
16397,-3,-1,I want to help those with disabilities fit into the mainstream.
16398,-3,-1,There is much to be done.
16399,-3,-1,This election is about big things.
16400,-3,-1,And perhaps the biggest is world peace.
16401,-3,-1,And I ask you to consider the experience I have had in working with a President who has revolutionized the situation around the world.
16405,-3,-1,"I'd love to be able to say to my grandchildren, four years after my first term, I'd like to say, your grandfather, working with the leaders of the Soviet Union, working with the leaders of Europe, was able to ban chemical and biological weapons from the face of the earth."
16406,-3,0,Lincoln called this country the last best hope of man on earth.
16407,-3,-1,"And he was right then, and we still are the last best hope of man on earth."
16411,-3,-1,"Thank you very, very much."
16438,-3,-1,First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to - back to work of our people as a top priority.
16439,-3,-1,"This is uh - an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh - business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project."
16446,-3,-1,Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah - cha- in - in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work.
16447,-3,-1,"Another very important - uh aspect of our - uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down - uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past."
16448,-3,-1,"These uh - kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in - in reducing uh unemployment."
16449,-3,-1,"There is uh - uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very - very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management - business on the one hand, and labor, on the other."
16450,-3,-1,In a Transfer interrupted!
16451,-3,-1,"ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job - job - uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people - uh and also sharing with uh - local governments the uh - payment of salaries which would uh - let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level."
16454,-3,-1,"Yes, in unemployment that is likely to create additional pressure on prices, how willing are you to consider an incomes policy, in other words, wage and price controls?"
16455,-3,1,Well - we now have such uh - a low utilization of uh - our productive capacity - uh about 73 percent; I think it's about the lowest since the Great Depression years - and such a high unemployment rate now - uh 7.9 percent - that - uh we have a long way to go in getting people to work before we have the inflationary pressures.
16456,-3,-1,"And I think this would uh - this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that - that would be necessary."
16458,-3,-1,But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh - income levels uh - above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh - profitable than - than work.
16461,-3,1,I notice particularly that he didn't endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform.
16463,-3,1,"It would've called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh - expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy."
16466,-3,-1,We could uh - also uh - help our youths with some of the proposals that uh - would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college.
16473,-3,1,"At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut - three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business."
16475,-3,1,"And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction."
16476,-3,1,"In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person."
16479,-3,1,"In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending."
16480,-3,1,For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh - about 11 percent per year.
16481,-3,-1,We can't afford that kind of growth in federal spending.
16482,-3,1,And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half - a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent.
16484,-3,-1,"And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we'll get more revenue and we'll have a more prosperous economy."
16489,-3,-1,"I think the Congress should have uh - added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars."
16491,-3,1,"I'm sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended."
16492,-3,-1,So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending.
16494,-3,-1,It has some good provisions in it.
16496,-3,-1,"On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with - tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there's more good than bad."
16497,-3,-1,"And from the a- analysis that I've made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh - justify my signature and my approval."
16503,-3,1,"In uh - January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests."
16504,-3,1,"In uh - December of uh - 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation."
16505,-3,-1,"The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh - my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take 'em off on the corporations."
16506,-3,1,"As a matter fact, in - sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we've had a reduction in uh - in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent."
16515,-3,-1,"Well, as a matter of fact there is."
16516,-3,1,"If we assume the ah - uh - a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the - the - the - uh wa uh - Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent - under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does - my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh - and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year '81 which will be the last year of this next term."
16519,-3,-1,I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances.
16520,-3,-1,And uh - these projections have been very carefully made.
16529,-3,-1,And uh - with that uh - in that framework would befit the - any improvements in the programs.
16530,-3,-1,"Now this does not include uh - any uh - uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs."
16532,-3,-1,The present bureaucratic structure of the - of the Federal Government is a mess.
16533,-3,-1,"And if I'm elected president that's gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change."
16535,-3,-1,"But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if I'm elected president."
16536,-3,-1,Keep my promises to the American people.
16537,-3,-1,"And it's just predicated on very modest, but I think accurate, projections of employment increases and uh - a growth in our national economy equal to what was experienced under Kennedy, Johnson, before the Vietnam War."
16540,-3,-1,I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don't think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about.
16541,-3,-1,It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high.
16542,-3,1,"But I am uh - very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area."
16543,-3,1,"And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers."
16544,-3,1,"And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that've been taken uh - we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief."
16545,-3,1,"Now it seems to me that uh - as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn't going to be any $60 billion dividend."
16546,-3,-1,I've heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.
16553,-3,1,The amnesty program that I recommended in Chicago in September of 1974 would give to all draft evaders and - uh military deserters the opportunity to earn their uh - good record back.
16554,-3,1,About fourteen to fifteen thousand did take advantage of that program.
16555,-3,-1,We gave them ample time.
16556,-3,-1,I am against- an across-the-board pardon of draft evaders or military deserters.
16560,-3,-1,"It seemed to me that if I was to uh adequately and effectively handle the problems of high inflation, a growing recession, the uh - involvement of the United States still in Vietnam that I had to give a hundred percent of my time to those two major problems."
16563,-3,1,The first President out of thirty-eight that ever resigned from public office under pressure.
16564,-3,-1,"So when you look at the penalty that he paid, and when you analyze the requirements that I had - to spend all of my time working on the economy, which was in trouble, that I inherited; working on our problems in Southeast Asia - which were still plaguing us - it seemed to me that Mr. Nixon had been penalized enough by his resignation in disgrace and the need, and necessity for me to concentrate on the problems of the country fully justified the action that I took."
16568,-3,-1,I do not agree with that point of view.
16569,-3,1,"I gave, in September of 1974, an opportunity for all draft evaders, all deserters, to come in voluntarily, clear their records by earning an opportunity to restore their good citizenship."
16570,-3,-1,I think we gave them a good opportunity - we're - I don't think we should go any further.
16572,-3,-1,Well I think it's uh... very difficult for President Ford to uh - explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and - and uh - his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws.
16574,-3,-1,There's a difference in my opinion - uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary.
16575,-3,-1,Amnesty means that - that you uh - that what you did was right.
16576,-3,0,"Pardon means that what you did, whether it's right or wrong, you're forgiven for it."
16577,-3,-1,And I do advocate a pardon for - for draft evaders.
16580,-3,-1,"We've got a - a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime - the - the - the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and - and who have uh no influence - uh quite often are the ones who are punished."
16581,-3,-1,"And - and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is - is what - uh - is a - is a major problem that addresses our - our leader and this is something that hasn't been addressed adequately by - by this administration."
16582,-3,-1,But I - I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a - a fair uh - criminal justice system and also to - to bring about uh - an end to the - to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War.
16588,-3,1,"When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions - uh some uh - fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict."
16589,-3,1,And we cut those three hundred - uh agencies and so forth down substantially.
16590,-3,1,We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them.
16591,-3,-1,We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a - a tremendous success.
16594,-3,-1,I intend to do the same thing if I'm elected president.
16596,-3,0,We now have uh - a greatly expanded White House staff.
16597,-3,1,"When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on - on the White House and its staff."
16602,-3,1,"For instance, we now have uh - in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this."
16603,-3,0,Medicaid's in one agency; Medicare is in a different one.
16604,-3,-1,The - the check on the quality of health care is in a different one.
16606,-3,-1,This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program.
16608,-3,1,Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy.
16609,-3,1,"We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh - information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government."
16610,-3,-1,"This is a - a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I'm elected - and I intend to be - then it's gonna be done."
16613,-3,-1,I can't say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in.
16616,-3,1,"Also, we had a - a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year."
16617,-3,1,But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services.
16619,-3,1,We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers.
16621,-3,-1,The same thing will be done uh - at the federal government level.
16622,-3,1,I - I accomplished this with s - substantial reductions in employees in some departments.
16623,-3,1,"For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh - we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees."
16624,-3,1,"In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees."
16625,-3,-1,"But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a - was a uh - substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization."
16627,-3,-1,"If we don't, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue."
16628,-3,-1,There's no way for our people now to understand what their government is.
16629,-3,-1,There's no way to get the answer to a question.
16630,-3,1,"When you come to Washington to try to - as a governor - to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program."
16632,-3,-1,This is the kind of change that would be made.
16635,-3,1,"I think the record should show, Mr. Newman, that uh - the Bureau of Census - we checked it just yesterday - indicates that uh - in the four years that uh - Governor Carter was governor of the state of Georgia, uh - expenditures by the government went up over 50 percent Uh - employees of the government in Georgia during his term of office went up over 25 percent; and the figures also show that the uh, uh - bonded indebtedness of the state of Georgia during his governorship went up over 20 percent."
16638,-3,1,Now let me talk about what we've done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor.
16639,-3,1,And in the term that I've been president - some two years - we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand.
16641,-3,1,"We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we've made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president."
16642,-3,-1,"So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor's programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan."
16651,-3,1,"We were faced with uh - heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment."
16652,-3,1,"But in the last uh - twenty-four months we've turned the economy around and we've brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh - well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today - the most in the history of the country."
16653,-3,-1,The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts.
16654,-3,-1,And I think we'll have some decrease in our disbursements.
16657,-3,1,We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments.
16659,-3,-1,"We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws."
16664,-3,1,It's my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh - he approves of a $30 billion uh - expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned.
16665,-3,1,At the present time we're spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars.
16666,-3,-1,I don't know where that money would come from.
16667,-3,-1,"But as we look at the quality-of-life programs - jobs, health, education, crime, recreation - we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required."
16669,-3,-1,"We feel that uh - with the programs that I have recommended, the additional $10 billion tax cut, with the moderate increases in the quality-of-life area, we can still have a balanced budget which I will submit to the Congress in January of 1978."
16670,-3,-1,"We won't wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh - indicates."
16671,-3,1,"As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year."
16675,-3,-1,"Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh - Governor Carter recommends."
16677,-3,1,We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars - uhh maximum each year to the federal budget.
16684,-3,1,"I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh - later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy's proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost."
16685,-3,-1,The best thing to do is to look at the record uh - of Mr. Ford's Administration and Mr. Nixon's before his.
16686,-3,1,Uh - we had last year a $65 billion deficit - the largest deficit in the history of our country - more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy.
16687,-3,1,"We've got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford's been in office two years, we've had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million."
16689,-3,1,He's got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself.
16690,-3,1,"This uh - talking about more people at work - uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh - two years, it means that - that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn't want to because their fathers didn't make enough to pay the increased cost of uh - food and uh housing and clothing."
16691,-3,1,"We have uh - in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh - at the same time we've had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we've had a negative growth in our - in our national economy measured in real dollars."
16693,-3,-1,This is the kind of record that's there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn't go.
16701,-3,1,But the energy - uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration.
16702,-3,1,I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us.
16705,-3,1,I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence.
16706,-3,-1,We've got to have a - a firm way to handle the energy question.
16707,-3,1,The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step.
16709,-3,-1,We're gonna run out of oil.
16710,-3,1,When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil.
16712,-3,1,We now import about 44 percent of our oil.
16715,-3,-1,We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures.
16716,-3,-1,"And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power."
16717,-3,-1,I would certainly uh - not cut out atomic power altogether.
16718,-3,-1,We can't afford to give up that opportunity until later.
16719,-3,-1,"But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained."
16721,-3,-1,There ought to be a standardized design.
16722,-3,-1,"There ought to be a full-time uh - atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops."
16723,-3,-1,"These kinds of uh - procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated."
16728,-3,-1,Some of the things that can be done about this is a change in the rate structure of electric power companies.
16731,-3,-1,"We don't have an adequate requirement for the insulation of homes, for the efficiency of automobiles."
16732,-3,1,"And whenever the uh - automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can't meet the uh - amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates."
16735,-3,-1,Uh - this would - would help a great deal.
16736,-3,-1,So mandatory conservation measures - yes.
16737,-3,-1,Encouragement by the president for people to uh voluntarily conserve - yes.
16738,-3,-1,And also the private sector ought to be encouraged to - to bring forward to the public the benefits from efficiency.
16741,-3,-1,"These kinds of things uh - ought to be done, uh they ought to be encouraged and supported, and even required uh by the government, yes."
16743,-3,-1,Governor Carter skims over a very serious and a very broad subject.
16747,-3,-1,If you're going to increase domestic oil and gas production - and we have to - you have to give those producers an opportunity to uh - develop their land or their wells.
16749,-3,-1,"In order to do that we have to improve our extraction of coal from the ground; we have to improve our utilization of coal - make it more efficient, make it cleaner."
16750,-3,-1,In addition we uh - have to expand our research and development.
16751,-3,1,"In my program for energy independence we have increased, for example, solar energy research from about $84 million a year to about a hundred and twenty million dollars a year."
16753,-3,1,"In nuclear power we have increased the research and development, uh - under the Energy Research and Development Agency uh - very substantially, to insure that our ener- uh - nuclear power plants are safer, that they are more efficient, and that we have adequate safeguards."
16761,-3,1,Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh - made available.
16763,-3,-1,Each one of those jobs would've cost the taxpayers $25 thousand.
16764,-3,1,"In addition, the jobs would not be available right now."
16766,-3,-1,The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment.
16769,-3,1,"For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months."
16770,-3,1,"We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States."
16772,-3,-1,Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs.
16773,-3,-1,"And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country."
16774,-3,-1,"I think it's uh - also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh - added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity."
16778,-3,1,"Well, that bill has not yet come down to the Oval Office, so I am not in a position to make any judgment on it tonight."
16780,-3,-1,"These make-work, temporary jobs - dead end as they are - are not the kind of jobs that we want for our people."
16781,-3,1,I think it's interesting to point out that uh - in the uh - two years that I've been president I've vetoed fifty-six bills.
16783,-3,1,"As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures."
16784,-3,1,"And the Congress by overriding the bills that I did veto, the Congress has added some $13 billion to the federal expenditures and to the federal deficit."
16786,-3,1,And yet he condemns the vetoes that I have made that has - that have saved the taxpayer $9 billion and could have saved an additional $13 billion.
16790,-3,1,"Well, Mr. Ford doesn't seem to put into perspective the fact that when - when uh five hundred thousand more people are out of work than there were three months ago, while we have two and a half million more people out of work than were when he took office, that this touches human beings."
16791,-3,0,"I was in uh - a city in uh - Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh - there were about four or five thousand people in the audience - it was on a - on a train trip."
16793,-3,1,About a thousand raised their hands.
16794,-3,1,Mr. Ford uh - actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office.
16795,-3,-1,And still he talks about - uh success.
16797,-3,-1,He says he's learned how to match unemployment with inflation.
16799,-3,1,"We've got the highest inflation we've had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago."
16800,-3,1,"And we've got uh - the highest unemployment we've had uh - under Mr. Ford's administration, since the Great Depression."
16801,-3,-1,"This affects human beings, and - and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration."
16802,-3,1,He hasn't saved $9 billion with his vetoes.
16803,-3,1,There's only been uh - a net savings of $4 billion.
16804,-3,1,"And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years."
16805,-3,1,"This is a - a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people's lives, and then it's covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation."
16807,-3,-1,It shows a lack of leadership.
16809,-3,1,Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon - per year.
16810,-3,1,And eleven of 'em have been overridden.
16811,-3,1,"One of his bills that was overridden - he only got one vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, from Republicans."
16821,-3,1,"Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system - as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace - ah of all the tax - benefits now, 25 percent of 'em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country."
16823,-3,1,"Mr. Ford has - has advocated since he's been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income - not from labor - but from investments."
16824,-3,-1,That's got to be changed.
16826,-3,-1,"When they don't pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them."
16827,-3,-1,"Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and - and builds a shoe factory, they don't have to pay any taxes on the money."
16829,-3,1,"This permits a company to create uh - a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them."
16830,-3,1,This costs our uh - government about uh - $1.4 billion a year.
16831,-3,-1,"And when those rich corporations don't pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for 'em."
16832,-3,-1,"Another one that's uh - that's very important is the uh - is the business deductions, uh - jet airplanes, uh - first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch."
16833,-3,-1,"The average working person can't - uh - can't take advantage of that, but the - the wealthier people - uh can."
16835,-3,-1,"Uh - there was one example, for instance, where uh - somebody uh - produced pornographic movies."
16836,-3,1,They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings.
16839,-3,-1,You can't hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks.
16843,-3,1,"You need about, according to Congressional committees on this, you need about $10 billion."
16844,-3,1,Now you listed some things - the uh - deferral on foreign income as estimated: that would save about $500 million.
16845,-3,1,"DISC, you said, was about 1.4 billion."
16849,-3,-1,I think that would be a - a very serious mistake.
16850,-3,-1,"But uh - if - if you could just do away with the ones that are unfair, you could lower taxes for everyone."
16852,-3,-1,"What I wanna do is not to raise taxes, but to eliminate loopholes."
16854,-3,1,"These programs that I described to you earlier - the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh - they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it."
16855,-3,-1,It's to make sure that everybody pays taxes on the income that they earn and make sure that you take whatever savings there is from the higher income levels and give it to the lower- and middle-income families.
16858,-3,1,In that interview uh - Governor Carter indicated that uh - he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher.
16859,-3,1,"Now if you uh - take the medium or middle-income taxpayer - that's about $14 thousand per person - uh - Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country."
16860,-3,-1,I think uh - the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars.
16862,-3,-1,"I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption."
16864,-3,-1,"Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes."
16865,-3,1,The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year.
16866,-3,1,"President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year."
16867,-3,1,"I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year."
16868,-3,1,My average in two years is twenty-six.
16869,-3,1,But in the process of that we have saved uhh - $9 billion.
16884,-3,-1,"The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States."
16885,-3,-1,"For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like."
16886,-3,-1,It - the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States.
16888,-3,1,"We, in addition, see that uh - in the last uh - four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh - the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society."
16890,-3,-1,And I don't see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership.
16891,-3,-1,"So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress."
16893,-3,-1,They have too many employees.
16894,-3,-1,There's some question about their morality.
16895,-3,-1,"It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator."
16901,-3,-1,"Well, It seems to me that uh - we have a chance - the Republicans - to get a majority in the House of Representatives."
16902,-3,-1,We will make some gains in the United States Senate.
16903,-3,-1,"So there will be different ratios in the House, as well as in the Senate, and as president I will be able to uh - work with that Congress."
16904,-3,-1,"But let me take the other side of the coin, if I might."
16905,-3,-1,Supposing we had - had a Democratic Congress for the last two years and we'd had uh - Governor Carter as President.
16906,-3,-1,"He has, in effect, said that he would agree with all of - he would disapprove of the vetoes that I have made, and would have added significantly to expenditures and the deficit in the federal government."
16907,-3,-1,I think it would be contrary to one of the basic concepts in our system of government - a system of checks and balances.
16910,-3,-1,"I think the American people want a Republican president to check on any excesses that come out of the next Congress, if it is a Democratic Congress."
16918,-3,1,I think under presidents For- uh - Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation.
16919,-3,-1,This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward.
16920,-3,-1,"This is government by stalemate, and we've seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country."
16923,-3,-1,"That, I think, is a good balance."
16926,-3,-1,"And there's been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that's not the way this country ought to be run."
16944,-3,-1,I would have uh - done it opposite.
16945,-3,-1,"I think the uh - problem should've been addressed by increasing productivity, by having uh - put - put people back to work so they could purchase more goods, lower income taxes on individuals, perhaps raise them, if necessary, on corporations in comparison."
16947,-3,-1,I would not wanna destroy the - the independence of the uh Federal Reserve - uh Board.
16948,-3,-1,"But I do think we ought to have a cohesive economic policy with at - at least the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and the president's terms being uh - the same and letting the Congress, of course, be the third uh - entity with uh - with independence subject only to the president's veto."
16950,-3,-1,The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent.
16951,-3,0,"Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations."
16952,-3,-1,As the result in the last uh - two years uh - we have had a responsible monetary policy.
16953,-3,1,Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half.
16955,-3,-1,It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh - party that was in power.
16956,-3,-1,It's important for our future uhh - economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh - separate from the executive and the Legislative branches.
16963,-3,1,"You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others."
16964,-3,1,We've done that by executive order.
16965,-3,-1,Uhh - and I think uh - we've tightened it up; we've uh - straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years.
16966,-3,-1,It doesn't seem to me that it's needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard.
16970,-3,-1,"So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I've done, we have to do it by executive order."
16971,-3,-1,And I'm glad that we have a good director in George Bush.
16984,-3,-1,There has been too much government secrecy and not uh - not enough respect for the personal privacy of American citizens.
16990,-3,-1,It's a time for unity.
16992,-3,-1,"It's time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate."
16994,-3,-1,"For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to."
16997,-3,-1,It needs to be competent.
16998,-3,-1,"The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that's sensitive to our people's needs - to those who are poor, who don't have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who've been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart."
16999,-3,-1,We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government.
17001,-3,-1,We've got a government of stalemate.
17002,-3,-1,We've lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be.
17003,-3,-1,This is not the America that we've known in the past.
17004,-3,-1,It's not the America that we have to have in the future.
17005,-3,-1,I don't claim to know all the answers.
17006,-3,-1,But I've got confidence in my country.
17008,-3,-1,"Our system of government - in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate - is still the best system of government on earth."
17009,-3,-1,"And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore."
17010,-3,-1,We need a president who can go in - who derives his strength from the people.
17011,-3,-1,I owe the special interests nothing.
17013,-3,-1,And I believe that we can bind our wounds.
17014,-3,-1,I believe that we can work together.
17015,-3,-1,"And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for - that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth."
17019,-3,-1,A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he's promised.
17021,-3,-1,A president should be the same thing to all people.
17025,-3,-1,"Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government."
17027,-3,0,On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday - for our great country.
17029,-3,-1,It was a glorious day.
17030,-3,-1,In the first century of our nation's history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind.
17032,-3,-1,Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us.
17033,-3,-1,In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education.
17035,-3,-1,We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have.
17036,-3,-1,The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine.
17037,-3,-1,The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities.
17039,-3,-1,Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others.
17040,-3,-1,"Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country."
17041,-3,-1,You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America.
17042,-3,-1,I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America.
17087,-3,-1,I have a plan -- not a secret plan.
17091,-3,-1,"So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy."
17093,-3,1,"Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates."
17094,-3,-1,"Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery."
17095,-3,1,We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was.
17096,-3,1,"The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further."
17097,-3,1,"In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs -- there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military."
17098,-3,1,"So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending -- the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet."
17099,-3,-1,"And when they meet, that is a balanced budget."
17108,-3,1,"But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent."
17117,-3,-1,One of the key tests of leadership is whether one sees clearly the nature of the problems confronted by our nation.
17118,-3,-1,And perhaps the dominant domestic issue of our times is what do we do about these enormous deficits.
17120,-3,1,"But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars."
17122,-3,1,We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983.
17125,-3,1,"Virtually every economic analysis that I've heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit."
17126,-3,-1,"In other words, it doesn't converge as the President suggests."
17128,-3,-1,What that means is that we will continue to have devastating problems with foreign trade.
17130,-3,-1,Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation.
17131,-3,-1,"Real interest rates -- the real cost of interest -- will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we're moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession."
17140,-3,-1,The rate of defense spending increase can be slowed.
17142,-3,-1,And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life.
17143,-3,1,"And that's why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President's recommendations."
17148,-3,-1,I don't believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes.
17149,-3,1,"And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation's history took place 1977."
17150,-3,1,"And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion."
17152,-3,-1,"Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you're taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government's share of what it is taking."
17153,-3,-1,"With regard to Social Security, I hope there'll be more time than just this minute to mention that, but I will say this: A President should never say ""never.''"
17155,-3,-1,I will never stand for a reduction of the Social Security benefits to the people that are now getting them.
17157,-3,1,"Well, that's exactly the commitment that was made to the American people in 1980: He would never reduce benefits."
17158,-3,1,"And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent -- reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying -- with widows trying to get them through college."
17161,-3,-1,"I have fought for Social Security and Medicare and for things to help people who are vulnerable all my life, and I will do it as President of the United States."
17171,-3,-1,"Well, first of all, I think the first answer this evening suggests exactly what I'm saying."
17173,-3,-1,And it's also unfair to dump these tremendous bills on our children.
17175,-3,-1,No one else believes that's the case.
17176,-3,-1,"I do, and I'm standing up to the issue with an answer that's fair."
17177,-3,-1,I think that's what leadership is all about.
17180,-3,1,"Now, for three occasions, one after another, our Embassies were assaulted in the same way by a truck with demolitions."
17182,-3,1,"There was two or three commission reports, recommendations by the CIA, the State Department, and the others, and the third time there was even a warning from the terrorists themselves."
17183,-3,-1,"Now, I believe that a President must command that White House and those who work for him."
17184,-3,-1,"It's the toughest job on Earth, and you must master the facts and insist that things that must be done are done."
17185,-3,-1,"I believe that the way in which I will approach the Presidency is what's needed, because all my life that has been the way in which I have sought to lead."
17186,-3,-1,And that's why in this campaign I'm telling you exactly what I want to do.
17187,-3,-1,I am answering your questions.
17188,-3,-1,"I am trying to provide leadership now, before the election, so that the American people can participate in that decision."
17191,-3,-1,"Well, I think we're getting better all the time."
17192,-3,-1,"And I think tonight, as we contrast for the first time our differing approach to government, to values, to the leadership in this country, I think as this debate goes forward, the American people will have for the first time a chance to weigh the two of us against each other."
17193,-3,-1,"And I think, as a part of that process, what I am trying to say will come across, and that is that we must lead, we must command, we must direct, and a President must see it like it is."
17194,-3,-1,"He must stand for the values of decency that the American people stand for, and he must use the power of the White House to try to control these nuclear weapons and lead this world toward a safer world."
17198,-3,-1,"Well, whether he does or not, let me suggest my own idea about the leadership factor, since you've asked it."
17199,-3,1,"And, incidentally, I might say that with regard to the 25-percent cut in Social Security -- before I get to the answer to your question -- the only 25-percent cut that I know of was accompanying that huge 1977 tax increase, was a cut of 25 percent in the benefits for every American who was born after 1916."
17201,-3,-1,"First of all, I think you must have some principles you believe in."
17202,-3,-1,"In mine, I happen to believe in the people and believe that the people are supposed to be dominant in our society -- that they, not government, are to have control of their own affairs to the greatest extent possible, with an orderly society."
17204,-3,-1,I don't believe that a leader should be spending his time in the Oval Office deciding who's going to play tennis on the White House court.
17205,-3,-1,"And you let those people go with the guidelines of overall policy, not looking over their shoulder and nitpicking the manner in which they go at the job."
17206,-3,-1,"You are ultimately responsible, however, for that job."
17207,-3,-1,But I also believe something else about that.
17209,-3,-1,I don't want to hear them.
17210,-3,-1,I want to hear only arguments as to whether it is good or bad for the people -- is it morally right?
17211,-3,-1,"And on that basis and that basis alone, we make a decision on every issue."
17212,-3,1,"Now, with regard to my feeling about why I thought that his record bespoke his possible taking us back to the same things that we knew under the previous administration, his record is that he spoke in praise of deficits several times, said they weren't to be abhorred -- that, as a matter of fact, he at one time said he wished the deficit could be doubled, because they stimulate the economy and helped reduce unemployment."
17216,-3,-1,Our policy was not to cut subsidies.
17218,-3,-1,"And this is what we've been trying to do, is involve the Federal Government in such partnerships."
17220,-3,-1,"We have no thought of throwing people out into the snow, whether because of age or need."
17222,-3,1,"The safety net is there, and we're taking care of more people than has ever been taken care of before by any administration in this country."
17224,-3,-1,"Well, I guess I'm reminded a little bit of what Will Rogers once said about Hoover."
17225,-3,-1,"He said, ""It's not what he doesn't know that bothers me; it's what he knows for sure that just ain't so.''"
17226,-3,1,[Laughter] The fact of it is: The President's budget sought to cut Social Security by 25 percent.
17228,-3,-1,"And when the President was asked the other day, ""What do you want to cut in the budget?"
17230,-3,-1,That's Social Security and Medicare.
17232,-3,-1,"So, if he'd had his way, there wouldn't have been any housing project there at all."
17238,-3,1,Social Security was due to go bankrupt before 1983.
17241,-3,0,"And then in 1982, they used that proposal in a demagogic fashion for the 1982 campaign."
17242,-3,1,"And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke."
17243,-3,1,"Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks."
17245,-3,1,"And so, the whole matter of what to do with Social Security has been resolved by bipartisan legislation, and it is on a sound basis now for as far as you can see into the next century."
17250,-3,0,"In our particular church, we did not use that term, ""born again,'' so I don't know whether I would fit that -- that particular term."
17251,-3,-1,"But I have -- thanks to my mother, God rest her soul -- the firmest possible belief and faith in God."
17252,-3,-1,"And I don't believe -- I believe, I should say, as Lincoln once said, that I could not -- I would be the most stupid man in the world if I thought I could confront the duties of the office I hold if I could not turn to someone who was stronger and greater than all others."
17253,-3,-1,And I do resort to prayer.
17254,-3,-1,"At the same time, however, I have not believed that prayer should be introduced into an election or be a part of a political campaign -- or religion a part of that campaign."
17255,-3,0,"As a matter of fact, I think religion became a part of this campaign when Mr. Mondale's running mate said I wasn't a good Christian."
17256,-3,-1,"So, it does play a part in my life."
17257,-3,-1,I have no hesitancy in saying so.
17258,-3,-1,"And, as I say, I don't believe that I could carry on unless I had a belief in a higher authority and a belief that prayers are answered."
17261,-3,0,"I have gone to church regularly all my life, and I started to here in Washington."
17265,-3,0,We have seen the barricades that have had to be built around the White House.
17267,-3,-1,"And I miss going to church, but I think the Lord understands."
17272,-3,-1,"First of all, I accept President Reagan's affirmation of faith."
17273,-3,-1,"I'm sure that we all accept and admire his commitment to his faith, and we are strengthened, all of us, by that fact."
17275,-3,0,My wife is the daughter of a Presbyterian minister.
17276,-3,0,"And I don't know if I've been born again, but I know I was born into a Christian family."
17278,-3,-1,"Whether that helps or not, I don't know."
17279,-3,0,I have a deep religious faith.
17282,-3,-1,It's probably the reason that I'm in politics.
17284,-3,-1,And I think we're all together on that.
17285,-3,-1,"What bothers me is this growing tendency to try to use one's own personal interpretation of faith politically, to question others' faith, and to try to use the instrumentalities of government to impose those views on others."
17286,-3,-1,All history tells us that that's a mistake.
17289,-3,-1,That's why faith in the United States is pure and unpolluted by the intervention of politicians.
17290,-3,-1,"And I think if we want to continue -- as I do -- to have a religious nation, lets keep that line and never cross it."
17303,-3,-1,What I object to -- [applause] -- what I object to -- what I object to is someone seeking to use his faith to question the faith of another or to use that faith and seek to use the power of government to impose it on others.
17304,-3,-1,"A minister who is in civil rights or in the conservative movement, because he believes his faith instructs him to do that, I admire."
17309,-3,-1,"Yes, it's very difficult to rebut, because I find myself in so much agreement with Mr. Mondale."
17310,-3,-1,"I, too, want that wall that is in the Constitution of separation of church and state to remain there."
17313,-3,-1,A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can't do it because it's school property.
17314,-3,-1,"These are they types of things that I think have been happening in a kind of a secular way that have been eroding that separation, and I am opposed to that."
17315,-3,-1,"With regard to a platform on the Supreme Court, I can only say one thing about that."
17318,-3,-1,"And if I have the opportunity to appoint any more, I'll do it in the same manner that I did in selecting her."
17320,-3,-1,"The platform to which the President refers, in fact, calls for a religious test in the selection of judges."
17322,-3,1,And it would involve a religious test for the first time in American life.
17323,-3,-1,Let's take the example that the President cites.
17326,-3,-1,We've never had any difficulty finding time to pray.
17327,-3,-1,But do we want a constitutional amendment adopted of the kind proposed by the President that gets the local politicians into the business of selecting prayers that our children must either recite in school or be embarrassed and asked to excuse themselves?
17328,-3,-1,Who would write the prayer?
17330,-3,-1,How would it be resolved when those disputes occur?
17350,-3,-1,They don't want this arms race.
17351,-3,-1,And they don't want this deadly new effort to bring weapons into the heavens.
17352,-3,-1,And they want an American foreign policy that leads toward a safer world.
17353,-3,-1,"The American people see this debt, and they know it's got to come down."
17354,-3,-1,"And if it won't come down, the economy's going to slow down, maybe go into a recession."
17355,-3,1,"They see this tremendous influx and swamping of cheap foreign imports in this country that has cost over 3 million jobs, given farmers the worst year in American history."
17356,-3,-1,"And they know this debt must come down as well, because it's unfair to our children."
17357,-3,-1,The American people want this environment protected.
17359,-3,-1,The American people want their children educated.
17360,-3,-1,"They want to get our edge back in science, and they want a policy headed by the President that helps close this gap that's widening between the United States and Europe and Japan."
17362,-3,-1,They want those civil rights laws enforced.
17363,-3,-1,They want the equal rights amendment ratified.
17364,-3,-1,They want equal pay for comparable effort for women.
17366,-3,-1,"I think as you make the case, the American people will increasingly come to our cause."
17368,-3,0,"Well, tonight we had the first debate over the deficit."
17369,-3,-1,The President says it'll disappear automatically.
17371,-3,-1,I think the American people will draw their own conclusions.
17374,-3,-1,"As the record develops, I think it's going to become increasingly clear that what I am saying and where I want to take this country is exactly where the country wants to go, and the comparison of approaches is such that I think will lead to further strength."
17377,-3,-1,"Well, again, I'm running on the record."
17378,-3,-1,I think sometimes Mr. Mondale's running away from his.
17379,-3,-1,But I'm running on the record of what we have asked for.
17384,-3,1,"We have, to one-third of what it was."
17386,-3,1,"We did, 25 percent across the board."
17390,-3,-1,"I said that we would become respected in the world once again and that we would refurbish our national defense to the place that we could deal on the world scene and then seek disarmament, reduction of arms, and, hopefully, an elimination of nuclear weapons."
17393,-3,-1,And I think this is something the American people see.
17394,-3,1,I think they also know that we had a commission that came in a year ago with a recommendation on education -- on excellence in education.
17395,-3,1,"And today, without the Federal Government being involved other than passing on to them, the school districts, the words from that commission, we find 35 States with task forces now dealing with their educational problems."
17396,-3,1,We find that schools are extending the curriculum to now have forced teaching of mathematics and science and so forth.
17397,-3,1,All of these things have brought an improvement in the college entrance exams for the first time in some 20 years.
17398,-3,-1,"So, I think that many Democrats are seeing the same thing this Democrat saw: The leadership isn't taking us where we want to go."
17402,-3,1,"Crime has come down the last 2 years, for the first time in many, many decades that it has come down -- or since we've kept records -- 2 consecutive years, and last year it came down the biggest drop in crime that we've had."
17405,-3,-1,"Yes, I feel as strongly as anyone about the preservation of the environment."
17406,-3,1,"When we took office, we found that the national parks were so dirty and contained so many hazards, lack of safety features, that we stopped buying additional park land until we had rectified this with what was to be a 5-year program -- but it's just about finished already -- a billion dollars."
17407,-3,-1,And now we're going back to budgeting for additional lands for our parks.
17408,-3,1,"We have added millions of acres to the wilderness lands, to the game refuges."
17417,-3,-1,"And I'm very happy that John Kennedy was elected, because John Kennedy looked at the future with courage, saw what needed to be done, and understood his own government."
17421,-3,-1,"And instead of retreating -- instead of being strong where we should be strong, he wants to make it strong and intervene in the most private and personal questions in American life."
17422,-3,-1,That's where government should not be.
17424,-3,0,"Before I campaigned as a Democrat for a Republican candidate for President, I had already voted for Dwight Eisenhower to be President of the United States."
17427,-3,-1,I found that was rather difficult to do.
17432,-3,1,"The farmers were the victims of the double-digit inflation and the 211/2-percent interest rates of the Carter-Mondale administration and the grain embargo, which destroyed our reliability nationwide as a supplier."
17446,-3,-1,"Now, that I would want to see in any judge and with regard to any issue having to do with human life."
17447,-3,-1,"But with regard to abortion, and I have a feeling that this is -- there's been some reference without naming it here in the remarks of Mr. Mondale tied to injecting religion into government."
17448,-3,-1,"With me, abortion is not a problem of religion, it's a problem of the Constitution."
17449,-3,-1,"I believe that until and unless someone can establish that the unborn child is not a living human being, then that child is already protected by the Constitution, which guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness to all of us."
17450,-3,-1,"And I think that this is what we should concentrate on, is trying -- I know there were weeks and weeks of testimony before a Senate committee, there were medical authorities, there were religious -- there were clerics there -- everyone talking about this matter of prolife."
17451,-3,1,"And at the end of all of that, not one shred of evidence was introduced that the unborn child was not alive."
17452,-3,0,"We have seen premature births that are now grown-up, happy people going around."
17453,-3,-1,"Also, there is a strange dichotomy in this whole position about our courts ruling that abortion is not the taking of a human life."
17454,-3,1,"In California, sometime ago, a man beat a woman so savagely that her unborn child was born dead with a fractured skull, and the California State Legislature unanimously passed a law that was signed by the then-Democratic Governor -- signed a law that said that any man who so abuses a pregnant woman that he causes the death of her unborn child shall be charged with murder."
17464,-3,1,It was only when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that the Federal Government intervened in what had always been a State policy.
17466,-3,-1,"So, I would think that this would be the point of enforcement on this."
17467,-3,-1,"As I say, I feel that we have a problem here to resolve."
17468,-3,-1,And no one has approached it from that matter.
17470,-3,-1,I know that some churches do.
17471,-3,-1,"Now, it is a sin if you're taking a human life."
17473,-3,-1,"And therefore, I've always believed that a mother, if medically it is determined that her life is at risk if she goes through with the pregnancy, she has a right then to take the life of even her own unborn child in defense of her own."
17477,-3,-1,"I think your questions, however, underscore the fact there is probably no way that government should or could answer this question in every individual case and in the private lives of the American people."
17478,-3,1,The constitutional amendment proposed by President Reagan would make it a crime for a woman to have an abortion if she had been raped or suffered from incest.
17479,-3,-1,"Is it really the view of the American people, however you feel on the question of abortion, that government ought to be reaching into your livingrooms and making choices like this?"
17480,-3,-1,"I think it cannot work, won't work, and will lead to all kinds of cynical evasions of the law."
17481,-3,-1,Those who can afford to have them will continue to have them.
17482,-3,-1,The disadvantaged will go out in the back alley as they used to do.
17483,-3,-1,"I think these questions are inherently personal and moral, and every individual instance is different."
17486,-3,-1,"Now, the example that the President cites has nothing to do with abortion."
17489,-3,-1,But how does that compare with the problem of a woman who is raped?
17490,-3,-1,Do we really want those decisions made by judges who've been picked because they will agree to find the person guilty?
17491,-3,-1,"I don't think so, and I think it's going in exactly the wrong direction."
17492,-3,-1,"In America, on basic moral questions we have always let the people decide in their own personal lives."
17493,-3,-1,We haven't felt so insecure that we've reached for the club of state to have our point of view.
17496,-3,1,"One final point: President Reagan, as Governor of California, signed a bill which is perhaps the most liberal proabortion bill of any State in the Union."
17503,-3,-1,"And it's a personal and private, moral judgment."
17504,-3,-1,I don't know the answer to when life begins.
17505,-3,-1,"And it's not that simple, either."
17507,-3,-1,"And if it's rape, how do you draw moral judgments on that?"
17508,-3,-1,"If it's incest, how do you draw moral judgments on that?"
17518,-3,-1,"Well, with regard to this being a personal choice, isn't that what a murderer is insisting on, his or her right to kill someone because of whatever fault they think justifies that?"
17519,-3,-1,"Now, I'm not capable, and I don't think you are, any of us, to make this determination that must be made with regard to human life."
17521,-3,-1,I don't think that any of us should be called upon here to stand and make a decision as to what other things might come under the self-defense tradition.
17522,-3,-1,"That, too, would have to be worked out then, when you once recognize that we're talking about a life."
17524,-3,1,There are a million and a half people out there standing in line waiting to adopt children who can't have them any other way.
17528,-3,-1,But the question is whether this other option proposed by the President should be pursued.
17529,-3,-1,And I don't agree with it.
17531,-3,0,The question of agriculture came up a minute ago.
17532,-3,1,"Net farm income is off 50 percent in the last 3 years, and every farmer knows it."
17533,-3,1,"And the effect of these economic policies is like a massive grain embargo, which has caused farm exports to drop 20 percent."
17534,-3,-1,It's been a big failure.
17535,-3,1,I opposed the grain embargo in my administration.
17536,-3,-1,I'm opposed to these policies as well.
17551,-3,1,"Under the 1981 tax bill, people making $200,000 a year got $60,000 in tax relief over 3 years, while people making $30,000 a year, all taxes considered, got no relief at all or their taxes actually went up."
17553,-3,-1,What does this mean in real life?
17556,-3,1,In 1981 I think he paid about 40 percent in taxes.
17558,-3,1,That meant that he paid a lower percent in taxes than the janitor who cleaned up his office or the chauffeur who drives him to work.
17559,-3,-1,I believe we need some fairness.
17565,-3,-1,"Mr. Reagan, after the election, is going to have to propose a tax increase, and you will have to compare what he proposes."
17568,-3,1,They hit middle- and moderate-income Americans and leave wealthy Americans largely untouched.
17570,-3,-1,"As soon as we get the economy on a sound ground as well, I'd like to see the total repeal of indexing."
17571,-3,-1,I don't think we can do that for a few years.
17572,-3,-1,"But at some point, we want to do that as well."
17575,-3,-1,"You know, I wasn't going to say this at all, but I can't help it."
17577,-3,-1,[Laughter] I don't have a plan to tax -- or increase taxes.
17579,-3,1,"I can understand why you are, Mr. Mondale, because as a Senator you voted 16 times to increase taxes."
17580,-3,-1,"Now, I believe that our problem has not been that anybody in our country is undertaxed; it's that government is overfed."
17581,-3,1,And I think that most of our people -- this is why we had a 25-percent tax cut across the board which maintained the same progressivity of our tax structure in the brackets on up.
17582,-3,1,"And, as a matter of fact, it just so happens that in the quirks of administering these taxes, those above $50,000 actually did not get quite as big a tax cut percentage-wise as did those from 50,000 down."
17583,-3,1,"From 50,000 down, those people paid two-thirds of the taxes, and those people got two-thirds of the tax cut."
17584,-3,-1,"Now, the Social Security tax of '77 -- this indeed was a tax that hit people in the lower brackets the hardest."
17587,-3,1,"At the same time every year, it increased the amount of money -- virtually every year, there may have been one or two that were skipped in there -- that was subject to that tax."
17588,-3,1,"Today it is up to about $38,000 of earnings that is subject to the payroll tax for Social Security."
17589,-3,1,"And that tax, there are no deductions, so a person making anywhere from 10, 15, 20 -- they're paying that tax on the full gross earnings that they have after they have already paid an income tax on that same amount of money."
17590,-3,-1,"Now, I don't think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich, and not the other way around, it just doesn't work out that way."
17591,-3,-1,"The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity, as I've said, and that has not been changed."
17593,-3,1,"Yes, but he paid 10 times as much, also."
17598,-3,-1,"Yes, I had used -- ""last resort'' would always be with me."
17601,-3,-1,"With regard to assailing Mr. Bush about his tax problems and the difference from the tax he once paid and then the later tax he paid, I think if you looked at the deductions, there were great legal expenses in there -- had to do, possibly, with the sale of his home, and they had to do with his setting up of a blind trust."
17602,-3,1,"All of those are legally deductions, deductible in computing your tax, and it was a 1-year thing with him."
17605,-3,-1,"Well, first of all, I gave him the benefit of the doubt on the house deal."
17606,-3,1,"I'm just talking about the 12.8 percent that he paid, and that's what's happening all over this country with wealthy Americans."
17608,-3,-1,"Now, Mr. President, you said, ""There you go again,'' right?"
17615,-3,1,You went out and tried to cut $20 billion out of Medicare.
17616,-3,-1,"And so, when you say, ""There you go again'' -- people remember this, you know."
17617,-3,1,"[Laughter] And people will remember that you signed the biggest tax increase in the history of California and the biggest tax increase in the history of the United States, and what are you going to do?"
17618,-3,1,You've got a $260 billion deficit.
17626,-3,1,"And, no, I never proposed any $20 billion should come out of Medicare; I have proposed that the program we must treat with that particular problem."
17627,-3,1,And maybe part of that problem is because during the 4 years of the Carter-Mondale administration medical costs in this country went up 87 percent.
17630,-3,-1,I gave you back some of that time.
17643,-3,-1,"Well, some of those facts and figures just don't stand up."
17644,-3,1,"Yes, there has been an increase in poverty, but it is a lower rate of increase than it was in the preceding years before we got here."
17645,-3,1,"It has begun to decline, but it is still going up."
17648,-3,-1,It had nothing to do with the transfer of payments from government by way of many programs.
17651,-3,1,"We have more people receiving food stamps than were ever receiving them before -- 2,300,000 more are receiving them -- even though we took 850,000 off the food stamp rolls because they were making an income that was above anything that warranted their fellow citizens having to support them."
17652,-3,1,We found people making 185 percent of the poverty level were getting government benefits.
17653,-3,1,We have set a line at 130 percent so that we can direct that aid down to the truly needy.
17656,-3,1,"But there, again, we found people that there under the previous administration, families that had no limit to income were still eligible for low-interest college loans."
17657,-3,-1,We didn't think that was right.
17659,-3,1,"So, there are a host of other figures that reveal that the grant programs are greater than they have ever been, taking care of more people than they ever have."
17660,-3,1,"7.7 million elderly citizens who were living in the lowest 20 percent of earnings -- 7.7 million have moved up into another bracket since our administration took over, leaving only 5 million of the elderly in that bracket when there had been more than 13 million."
17668,-3,-1,"I remember distinctly, I was segueing into another subject."
17669,-3,-1,"I was talking about the things that have been accomplished, and that was referring to the revival of patriotism and optimism, the new spirit that we're finding all over America."
17670,-3,-1,And it is a wonderful thing to see when you get out there among the people.
17671,-3,0,"So, that was the only place that that was used."
17672,-3,-1,"I did avoid, I'm afraid, in my previous answer, also, the idea of uneven, yes."
17678,-3,-1,"Number one, we've got to get the debt down to get the interest rates down so the economy will grow and people will be employed."
17679,-3,-1,"Number two, we have to work with cities and others to help generate economic growth in those communities -- through the Urban Development Action Grant Program."
17680,-3,-1,"I don't mind those enterprise zones; let's try them, but not as a substitute for the others."
17682,-3,-1,"If these young Americans don't have the skills that make them attractive to employees, they're not going to get jobs."
17683,-3,-1,The next thing is to try to get more entrepreneurship in business within the reach of minorities so that these businesses are located in the communities in which they're found.
17684,-3,-1,"The other thing is, we need the business community as well as government heavily involved in these communities to try to get economic growth."
17685,-3,-1,There is no question that the poor are worse off.
17687,-3,1,But the figures show that about 8 million more people are below the poverty line than 4 years ago.
17689,-3,-1,"Now, we need a tight budget, but there's no question that this administration has singled out things that affect the most vulnerable in American life, and they're hurting."
17690,-3,-1,One final point if I might.
17691,-3,-1,"There's another part of the lopsided economy that we're in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports."
17693,-3,-1,That's another reason to get the deficit down.
17697,-3,-1,"I know they're all for education in science and training, which I strongly support."
17698,-3,-1,They want these young people to have a chance to get jobs and the rest.
17700,-3,-1,I think they're asking for new and creative ways to try to reach it with everyone involved.
17701,-3,-1,I think that's part of it.
17702,-3,-1,I think also that the American people want a balanced program that gives us long-term growth so that they're not having to take money that's desperate to themselves and their families and give it to someone else.
17703,-3,-1,"I'm opposed to that, too."
17708,-3,1,"There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited -- that the interest rates came down from 211/2, down toward the 12 or 13 figure."
17711,-3,-1,"Now, if there was a connection I think that there would be a different parallel between deficits getting larger and interest rates going down."
17712,-3,0,The interest rates are based on inflation.
17714,-3,-1,"I think it can only be that they're anticipating or hope -- expecting, not hoping, that maybe we don't have a control of inflation and it's going to go back up again."
17715,-3,-1,"Well, it isn't going to go back up."
17716,-3,-1,We're going to see that it doesn't.
17717,-3,-1,And I haven't got time to answer with regard to the disabled.
17719,-3,0,"Mr. President, if I heard you correctly, you said that these deficits don't have anything to do with interest rates."
17720,-3,-1,"I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why -- energy prices and so on."
17722,-3,1,"But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what's called the real interest rates -- the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled -- and that's still the case today."
17724,-3,-1,"Everybody -- every economist, every businessman -- believes that."
17727,-3,-1,That deficit is ruining the long-term hopes for this economy.
17728,-3,-1,It's causing high interest rates.
17730,-3,1,It's given us the highest small business failure in 50 years.
17743,-3,-1,Do you want to give me some suggestions?
17744,-3,-1,[Laughter] I'm going to use my time a little differently.
17745,-3,-1,I'm going to give the President some credit.
17747,-3,-1,"What I think we need, however, is not just that but to move forward, not just congratulating ourselves but challenging ourselves to get on with the business of dealing with America's problems."
17751,-3,-1,"And this is not personal -- there are deep differences about our future, and that's the basis of my campaign."
17756,-3,-1,"Mr. Reagan, as you saw tonight -- President Reagan takes the position it will disappear by magic."
17758,-3,-1,"I wish the President would say: Yes, the CBO is right."
17759,-3,1,"Yes, we have a $263 billion deficit."
17762,-3,-1,"It's going to go in the other direction, as they've estimated."
17763,-3,-1,And give us a plan.
17765,-3,-1,Whose taxes will you raise?
17767,-3,-1,Are you going to go after Social Security and Medicare and student assistance and the handicapped again as you did last time?
17768,-3,-1,"If you'd just tell us what you're going to do, then the American people could compare my plan for the future with your plan."
17769,-3,-1,And that's the way it should be.
17770,-3,-1,The American people would be in charge.
17772,-3,-1,"Well, now, I have to start with a smile, since his kind words to me."
17774,-3,-1,And that is the continued discussion and claim that somehow I am the villain who is going to pull the Social Security checks out from those people who are dependent on them.
17776,-3,-1,"But why it is outrageous is because, for political advantage, every time they do that, they scare millions of senior citizens who are totally dependent on Social Security, have no place else to turn."
17777,-3,-1,"And they have to live and go to bed at night thinking, ""Is this true?"
17778,-3,-1,Is someone going to take our check away from us and leave us destitute?''
17779,-3,-1,And I don't think that that should be a part of political dialog.
17786,-3,-1,"Now, Social Security, let's lay it to rest once and for all."
17787,-3,-1,I told you never would I do such a thing.
17788,-3,1,"But I tell you also now, Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit."
17790,-3,1,"If you reduce the out-go of Social Security, that money would not go into the general fund to reduce a deficit."
17792,-3,-1,"So, Social Security has nothing to do with balancing a budget or erasing or lowering the deficit."
17797,-3,-1,"As to what we might do, and find in further savings cuts, no, we're not going to starve the hungry."
17798,-3,1,"But we have 2,478 specific recommendations from a commission of more than 2,000 business people in this country, through the Grace commission, that we're studying right now -- and we've already implemented 17 percent of them -- that are recommendations as to how to make government more efficient, more economic."
17800,-3,1,"Why the deficits are so much of a problem for him now, but that in 1976, when the deficit was $52 billion and everyone was panicking about that, he said, no, that he thought it ought to be bigger, because a bigger deficit would stimulate the economy and would help do away with unemployment."
17802,-3,1,"Remember, there was a trillion dollars in debt before we got here."
17803,-3,-1,"That's got to be paid by our children and grandchildren, too, if we don't do it."
17804,-3,-1,And I'm hoping we can start some payments on it before we get through here.
17805,-3,-1,That's why I want another 4 years.
17808,-3,-1,And the American people don't have the slightest clue about what President Reagan will do about these deficits.
17809,-3,-1,"[Laughter] And yet, that's the most important single issue of our time."
17812,-3,1,In 1979 we ran a $29 billion deficit all year.
17814,-3,-1,And the result is exactly what we see.
17817,-3,1,"Last report on new purchases, it's the lowest since 1982."
17818,-3,1,Growth is a little over 3 percent now.
17819,-3,-1,Many people are predicting a recession.
17820,-3,-1,And the flow of imports into this country is swamping the American people.
17821,-3,-1,"We've got to deal with this problem, and those of us who want to be your President should tell you now what we're going to do, so you can make a judgment."
17830,-3,-1,"No, I might as well just go with -- --"
17842,-3,-1,"Well, we'll include it in that."
17844,-3,-1,"Four years ago, in similar circumstances to this, I asked you, the American people, a question."
17847,-3,-1,"Now, maybe I'm expected to ask that same question again."
17848,-3,-1,"I'm not going to, because I think that all of you -- or not everyone, those people that are in those pockets of poverty and haven't caught up, they couldn't answer the way I would want them to -- but I think that most of the people in this country would say, yes, they are better off than they were 4 years ago."
17849,-3,-1,"The question, I think, should be enlarged."
17851,-3,-1,"And I believe the answer to that has to also be ""yes.''"
17852,-3,-1,I promised a new beginning.
17854,-3,-1,"If the job were finished, I might have thought twice about seeking reelection for this job."
17857,-3,1,Productivity in the first half of 1980 was down a minus 2 percent.
17859,-3,1,"Personal earnings after taxes per capita have gone up almost $3,000 in these 4 years."
17860,-3,1,"In 1980 -- or 1979, a person with a fixed income of $8,000 was $500 above the poverty line, and this maybe explains why there are the numbers still in poverty."
17861,-3,1,By 1980 that same person was $500 below the poverty line.
17863,-3,1,"With regard to business investment, it is higher than it has been since 1949."
17867,-3,1,"Yes, we have an increase in the defense budget."
17870,-3,1,Today we're well on our way to a 600-ship navy.
17871,-3,1,We have 543 at present.
17872,-3,-1,"We have -- our military, the morale is high."
17873,-3,1,"I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension."
17874,-3,-1,"And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons."
17875,-3,-1,"But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons."
17878,-3,-1,I think we've given the American people back their spirit.
17886,-3,-1,"Well, if you're wealthy, you're better off."
17887,-3,-1,"If you're middle income, you're about where you were."
17889,-3,0,That's what the economists tell us.
17890,-3,-1,But is that really the question that should be asked?
17891,-3,-1,Isn't the real question is will we be better off?
17892,-3,-1,Will our children be better off?
17893,-3,-1,Are we building the future that this nation needs?
17894,-3,-1,"I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you'll see that we need new leadership."
17895,-3,-1,Are we better of with this arms race?
17896,-3,-1,Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens?
17897,-3,-1,Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights?
17900,-3,-1,"Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?"
17902,-3,-1,I don't think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves.
17903,-3,-1,"And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited."
17904,-3,1,"When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability -- confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don't think that's what America is all about."
17906,-3,-1,I believe there's fundamental fairness crying out that needs to be achieved in our tax system.
17907,-3,-1,I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment.
17908,-3,-1,"And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful."
17909,-3,-1,"These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price."
17910,-3,-1,That's not fair for our future.
17911,-3,-1,"I think our future requires a President to lead us in an all-out search to advance our education, our learning, and our science and training, because this world is more complex and we're being pressed harder all the time."
17912,-3,-1,I believe in opening doors.
17917,-3,0,"President Kennedy once said in response to similar arguments, ""We are great, but we can be greater.''"
17918,-3,-1,"We can be better if we face our future, rejoice in our strengths, face our problems, and by solving them, build a better society for our children."
17970,-3,-1,But I also know how to lead those alliances.
17972,-3,-1,"I think that's wrong, and I think we can do better."
17973,-3,-1,I have a better plan for homeland security.
17978,-3,-1,"All of these, and especially homeland security, which we'll talk about a little bit later."
17985,-3,0,The rest of them know we're after them.
17986,-3,1,"We've upheld the doctrine that said if you harbor a terrorist, you're equally as guilty as the terrorist."
17987,-3,1,And the Taliban are no longer in power.
18001,-3,-1,"No, I don't believe it's going to happen."
18005,-3,-1,And I made some tough decisions.
18006,-3,-1,But people know where I stand.
18018,-3,-1,"That if given a chance to be free, they will show up at the polls."
18024,-3,-1,Because an enemy realizes the stakes.
18031,-3,-1,"But if we remain strong and resolute, we will defeat this enemy."
18033,-3,-1,I believe in being strong and resolute and determined.
18036,-3,1,"And smart means not diverting your attention from the real war on terror in Afghanistan against Osama bin Laden and taking if off to Iraq where the 9/11 Commission confirms there was no connection to 9/11 itself and Saddam Hussein, and where the reason for going to war was weapons of mass destruction, not the removal of Saddam Hussein."
18037,-3,-1,"This president has made, I regret to say, a colossal error of judgment."
18041,-3,1,"Unfortunately, he escaped in the mountains of Tora Bora."
18050,-3,0,"First of all, he made the misjudgment of saying to America that he was going to build a true alliance, that he would exhaust the remedies of the United Nations and go through the inspections."
18059,-3,-1,I don't believe the United States did that.
18060,-3,-1,And we pushed our allies aside.
18063,-3,1,"The center is Afghanistan, where, incidentally, there were more Americans killed last year than the year before; where the opium production is 75 percent of the world's opium production; where 40 to 60 percent of the economy of Afghanistan is based on opium; where the elections have been postponed three times."
18064,-3,1,"The president moved the troops, so he's got 10 times the number of troops in Iraq than he has in Afghanistan, where Osama bin Laden is."
18075,-3,0,So I went to the United Nations.
18085,-3,1,The facts are that he was systematically deceiving the inspectors.
18086,-3,-1,That wasn't going to work.
18087,-3,-1,"That's kind of a pre-September 10th mentality, the hope that somehow resolutions and failed inspections would make this world a more peaceful place."
18088,-3,-1,He was hoping we'd turn away.
18109,-3,-1,That's why Zarqawi and his people are trying to fight us.
18111,-3,-1,The biggest disaster that could happen is that we not succeed in Iraq.
18133,-3,-1,You don't send troops to war without the body armor that they need.
18141,-3,1,More soldiers killed in June than before.
18146,-3,1,"And we got weapons of mass destruction crossing the border every single day, and they're blowing people up."
18148,-3,-1,Can I respond to that?
18153,-3,-1,"I don't see how you can lead this country to succeed in Iraq if you say wrong war, wrong time, wrong place."
18155,-3,-1,What message does that send to our allies?
18159,-3,-1,"Yes, we have to be steadfast and resolved, and I am."
18160,-3,-1,"And I will succeed for those troops, now that we're there."
18176,-3,1,"The president hasn't put one nickel, not one nickel into the effort to fix some of our tunnels and bridges and most exposed subway systems."
18178,-3,-1,We hadn't done the work that ought to be done.
18179,-3,1,"The president -- 95 percent of the containers that come into the ports, right here in Florida, are not inspected."
18185,-3,1,"And long before President Bush and I get a tax cut -- and that's who gets it -- long before we do, I'm going to invest in homeland security and I'm going to make sure we're not cutting COPS programs in America and we're fully staffed in our firehouses and that we protect the nuclear and chemical plants."
18195,-3,-1,"Anyway, that's for another debate."
18204,-3,-1,And the enemy only has to be right once to hurt us.
18205,-3,-1,There's a lot of good people working hard.
18213,-3,1,"We just read on the front pages of America's papers that there are over 100,000 hours of tapes, unlistened to."
18214,-3,-1,On one of those tapes may be the enemy being right the next time.
18231,-3,1,"We've got 100,000 trained now, 125,000 by the end of this year, 200,000 by the end of next year."
18241,-3,-1,You can't do that and expect to win the war on terror.
18249,-3,-1,A free Iraq will enforce the hopes and aspirations of the reformers in places like Iran.
18257,-3,0,And they both looked at me and said: We need you.
18263,-3,-1,That's exactly where we find ourselves today.
18269,-3,-1,"Almost every step of the way, our troops have been left on these extraordinarily difficult missions."
18276,-3,-1,I think it's worthy for a follow-up.
18282,-3,-1,"Not a message a commander in chief gives, or this is a ""great diversion."""
18284,-3,-1,Not what a commander in chief does when you're trying to lead troops.
18286,-3,0,"Well, you know, when I talked about the $87 billion, I made a mistake in how I talk about the war."
18307,-3,-1,We will not make war inevitable.
18313,-3,1,"General Shinsheki, the Army chief of staff, said you're going to need several hundred thousand troops."
18326,-3,1,"To save for Halliburton the spoils of the war, they actually issued a memorandum from the Defense Department saying, ""If you weren't with us in the war, don't bother applying for any construction."""
18332,-3,1,They pulled out after Sergio de Mello got killed.
18337,-3,-1,You can't expect to build an alliance when you denigrate the contributions of those who are serving side by side with American troops in Iraq.
18338,-3,1,"Plus, he says the cornerstone of his plan to succeed in Iraq is to call upon nations to serve."
18343,-3,0,I deal with them all the time.
18344,-3,0,I sit down with the world leaders frequently and talk to them on the phone frequently.
18345,-3,-1,"They're not going to follow somebody who says, ""This is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time."""
18365,-3,-1,And I don't appreciate it when a candidate for president denigrates the contributions of these brave soldiers.
18376,-3,1,"But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared."
18387,-3,-1,"I know we're not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens."
18390,-3,1,"The plan says we'll train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are."
18396,-3,0,Japan will be hosting a summit.
18416,-3,1,"And today, we are 90 percent of the casualties and 90 percent of the costs."
18438,-3,-1,They just decided the time for diplomacy is over and rushed to war without planning for what happens afterwards.
18445,-3,-1,I believe that it is important to tell the truth to the American people.
18447,-3,-1,"And I know what many of them say today, and I know how to bring them back to the table."
18449,-3,-1,We need to be smarter about now we wage a war on terror.
18452,-3,-1,We need to rebuild our alliances.
18453,-3,-1,"I believe that Ronald Reagan, John Kennedy, and the others did that more effectively, and I'm going to try to follow in their footsteps."
18456,-3,1,He said Osama bin Laden uses the invasion of Iraq as an excuse to spread hatred for America.
18458,-3,-1,Osama bin Laden doesn't get to decide.
18477,-3,-1,I wasn't misleading when I said he was a threat.
18481,-3,-1,And the president chose the wrong way.
18489,-3,-1,"And we have a duty to our country and to future generations of America to achieve a free Iraq, a free Afghanistan, and to rid the world of weapons of mass destruction."
18493,-3,-1,"You know, every life is precious."
18498,-3,0,"She and her son Bryan, they came to see me."
18506,-3,-1,"And Saddam Hussein was a threat, and that we must spread liberty because in the long run, the way to defeat hatred and tyranny and oppression is to spread freedom."
18519,-3,-1,"And it reminds me that it is vital for us not to confuse the war, ever, with the warriors."
18524,-3,-1,And I want to make sure the outcome honors that nobility.
18532,-3,-1,And my plan has a better chance of standing up and fighting for those troops.
18540,-3,-1,This is an essential that we get it right.
18547,-3,-1,It's the wrong thing to do.
18567,-3,-1,What I want to do is change the dynamics on the ground.
18569,-3,-1,You have to close the borders.
18570,-3,-1,You've got to show you're serious in that regard.
18579,-3,-1,"Will you guys give us permission to shift it over into training?"""
18581,-3,1,"There are 100,000 troops trained, police, guard, special units, border patrol."
18582,-3,1,"There's going to be 125,000 trained by the end of this year."
18601,-3,-1,"But I think the president, again, still hasn't shown how he's going to go about it the right way."
18615,-3,-1,That's why it's essential we win.
18617,-3,-1,Under my leadership we're going to win this war in Iraq.
18621,-3,-1,I would hope I never have to.
18622,-3,-1,I understand how hard it is to commit troops.
18626,-3,-1,"I think that by speaking clearly and doing what we say and not sending mixed messages, it is less likely we'll ever have to use troops."
18636,-3,-1,And I would hope to never have to use force.
18640,-3,1,Libya is now peacefully dismantling its weapons programs.
18648,-3,1,Osama bin Laden attacked us.
18655,-3,1,"That's the enemy that is now in 60 countries, with stronger recruits."
18667,-3,-1,"And secondly, to think that another round of resolutions would have caused Saddam Hussein to disarm, disclose, is ludicrous, in my judgment."
18676,-3,1,"And while he's been diverted, with 9 out of 10 active duty divisions of our Army, either going to Iraq, coming back from Iraq, or getting ready to go, North Korea's gotten nuclear weapons and the world is more dangerous."
18688,-3,-1,"But if and when you do it, Jim, you have to do it in a way that passes the test, that passes the global test where your countrymen, your people understand fully why you're doing what you're doing and you can prove to the world that you did it for legitimate reasons."
18693,-3,-1,"The word of the president of the United States is good enough for me."""
18698,-3,-1,"But I'll tell you this: As president, I'll never take my eye off that ball."
18703,-3,-1,And I think we have a lot of earning back to do.
18711,-3,-1,And I wouldn't join it.
18728,-3,1,"And China's a got a lot of influence over North Korea, some ways more than we do."
18733,-3,-1,It's not going to work if we open up a dialogue with Kim Jong Il.
18739,-3,1,There's a special protocol recently been passed that allows for inspections.
18740,-3,-1,I hope we can do it.
18744,-3,-1,I believe we could have done better.
18750,-3,1,And we knew where the fuel rods were.
18755,-3,1,"And for two years, this administration didn't talk at all to North Korea."
18757,-3,1,"And today, there are four to seven nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea."
18759,-3,-1,"Now, that, I think, is one of the most serious, sort of, reversals or mixed messages that you could possibly send."
18776,-3,1,There are sanctions in place on Iran.
18790,-3,1,"Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide."
18795,-3,-1,We need to do more than that.
18800,-3,1,We've got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties.
18821,-3,1,"We helped stabilize the situation with some troops, and when the African Union came, we moved them out."
18828,-3,-1,"Well, first of all, I admire Senator Kerry's service to our country."
18836,-3,-1,"He changes positions on something as fundamental as what you believe in your core, in your heart of hearts, is right in Iraq."
18837,-3,-1,You cannot lead if you send mixed messages.
18841,-3,-1,And that's my biggest concern about my opponent.
18862,-3,-1,... and a great first lady.
18863,-3,-1,But we do have differences.
18865,-3,-1,I don't think that's my job or my business.
18869,-3,-1,"It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong."
18881,-3,0,I've never wilted in my life.
18892,-3,1,There's some 600-plus tons of unsecured material still in the former Soviet Union and Russia.
18895,-3,0,"I wrote a book about it several years ago -- six, seven years ago -- called ""The New War,"" which saw the difficulties of this international criminal network."
18897,-3,1,And the black market sale price was about $250 million.
18899,-3,1,"And this president, I regret to say, has secured less nuclear material in the last two years since 9/11 than we did in the two years preceding 9/11."
18902,-3,1,The president actually cut the money for it.
18904,-3,-1,And part of that leadership is sending the right message to places like North Korea.
18926,-3,1,This was a proliferator out of Pakistan that was selling secrets to places like North Korea and Libya.
18936,-3,-1,"Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear proliferation."
18947,-3,-1,"And if you enter bilateral talks, they'll be happy to walk away from the table."
18948,-3,-1,I don't think that'll work.
18957,-3,1,"He is -- listen, they went through a horrible situation in Beslan, where these terrorists gunned down young school kids."
18965,-3,0,"I look forward to discussing it more with him, as time goes on."
18967,-3,-1,Vladimir is going to have to make some hard choices.
18975,-3,-1,And I think it goes beyond just the response to terror.
18976,-3,1,Mr. Putin now controls all the television stations.
18981,-3,-1,But we always have to stand up for democracy.
18983,-3,-1,"Now, I'd like to come back for a quick moment, if I can, to that issue about China and the talks."
19001,-3,1,"You know, we looked at the same intelligence and came to the same conclusion: that Saddam Hussein was a grave threat."
19002,-3,-1,And I don't hold it against him that he said grave threat.
19019,-3,-1,But we have a different set of convictions about how we make our country stronger here at home and respected again in the world.
19023,-3,-1,I believe when we're strongest when we reach out and lead the world and build strong alliances.
19031,-3,-1,That's the country that I'm going to fight for.
19032,-3,-1,And I ask you to give me the opportunity to make you proud.
19037,-3,-1,"Thank you very much tonight, Jim."
19048,-3,-1,"I'll never turn over America's national security needs to leaders of other countries, as we continue to build those alliances."
19051,-3,-1,I believe that the free Iraq is in this nation's interests.
19053,-3,-1,And I believe both a free Afghanistan and a free Iraq will serve as a powerful example for millions who plead in silence for liberty in the broader Middle East.
19056,-3,-1,We've climbed the mighty mountain.
19058,-3,-1,"By being steadfast and resolute and strong, by keeping our word, by supporting our troops, we can achieve the peace we all want."
19089,-3,-1,"And thank you to the people of Hartford, our hosts."
19090,-3,-1,"I want to begin by saying again how much I respect Senator Dole and his record of public service and how hard I will try to make this campaign and this debate one of ideas, not insults."
19092,-3,-1,"I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play."
19093,-3,-1,I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives.
19095,-3,1,"Now there's a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace."
19098,-3,1,We cut the deficit by 60 percent.
19100,-3,1,We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans.
19101,-3,-1,"Now let's pass the tax cuts for education and child rearing, help with medical emergencies, and buying a home."
19103,-3,-1,Now let's expand it so more people can succeed as parents and in the work force.
19104,-3,1,"We passed 100,000 police, the assault weapons ban, the Brady Bill."
19105,-3,-1,Now let's keep going by finishing the work of putting the police on the street and tackling juvenile gangs.
19107,-3,-1,Now let's move a million people from welfare to work.
19108,-3,-1,"And most important, let's make education our highest priority so that every eight-year-old will be able to read, every 12-year-old can log onto the Internet, every 18-year-old can go to college."
19109,-3,-1,We can build that bridge to the 21st Century.
19110,-3,-1,And I look forward to discussing exactly how we're going to do it.
19114,-3,-1,"Thank the people of Hartford, the Commission, and all those out here who may be listening or watching."
19117,-3,0,"I have three very special people with me tonight: My wife, Elizabeth; my daughter, Robin, who has never let me down, and a fellow named Frank Carafa from New York, along with Ollie Manninen who helped me out in the mountains of Italy a few years back."
19119,-3,-1,And sometimes you can't go it alone.
19122,-3,-1,"And ever since that time, I've tried to give something back to my country, to the people who are watching us tonight."
19123,-3,-1,America is the greatest place on the face of the earth.
19124,-3,-1,"Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties."
19125,-3,-1,You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table.
19127,-3,-1,"But even more importantly, you worry about the future and will they have the same opportunities that you and I have had."
19129,-3,0,"Jack Kemp is my running mate, doing an outstanding job."
19130,-3,-1,"Now, I'm a plain-speaking man and I learned long ago that your word was your bond."
19131,-3,-1,And I promise you tonight that I'll try to address your concerns and not try to exploit them.
19132,-3,-1,"It's a tall order, but I've been running against the odds for a long time and, again, I'm honored to be here this evening."
19138,-3,-1,And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole.
19140,-3,1,"We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors."
19141,-3,1,"But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street."
19143,-3,-1,I've worked hard to help families impart values to their own children.
19144,-3,1,"I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they're young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television."
19146,-3,1,I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program.
19149,-3,-1,"I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people."
19151,-3,-1,We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people.
19152,-3,1,"One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion."
19153,-3,1,"Don't forget that, that happened in 1993."
19154,-3,1,"A tax increase, a tax on everybody in America."
19156,-3,1,"If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased."
19157,-3,1,"We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase."
19158,-3,-1,I guess I rely more on the individual.
19160,-3,-1,"Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people."
19161,-3,-1,That's my difference with the President.
19162,-3,-1,We'll have specific differences later.
19163,-3,-1,"He noted a few, but there are others."
19167,-3,-1,"But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries."
19169,-3,1,Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents.
19182,-3,1,"Men's wages haven't gone up, gone down."
19184,-3,1,We have the highest foreign debt in history.
19185,-3,-1,"And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off?"
19186,-3,-1,"Well, I guess some may be better off."
19189,-3,-1,But are the American people?
19190,-3,1,They're working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes.
19191,-3,1,"For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn."
19192,-3,1,"More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration."
19193,-3,-1,So some may be better off.
19194,-3,-1,They talk about family income being up.
19195,-3,1,"That's not true in Connecticut, family income is down."
19196,-3,0,And it's up in some cases because both parents are working.
19197,-3,-1,"One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government."
19198,-3,-1,"We're going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation."
19199,-3,-1,That's what America is all about.
19201,-3,1,"Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it's been in in 30 years."
19202,-3,1,"We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s."
19203,-3,1,Wages are goings up for the first time in a decade.
19205,-3,1,We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years.
19207,-3,1,We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995.
19208,-3,1,The average family's income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed.
19210,-3,-1,Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still.
19211,-3,-1,"How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children."
19212,-3,-1,That's what I want to focus on.
19216,-3,-1,"But in any event, I think we just look at the facts."
19217,-3,-1,"We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago."
19218,-3,-1,"It's not whether we're better off, it's whether they're better off."
19219,-3,-1,"Are you working harder to put food on the table, feed your children."
19220,-3,-1,Are your children getting a better education.
19223,-3,-1,"So, yes, some may be better off."
19224,-3,-1,"But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they'll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president."
19228,-3,-1,Let's look at the position.
19229,-3,1,"First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole's been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members."
19232,-3,1,"Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund."
19235,-3,1,"And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole's, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D'Amato, says that they can't possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him."
19237,-3,-1,And we'll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers.
19238,-3,-1,But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine.
19242,-3,-1,I thought it was a good program.
19244,-3,0,"In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I've got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don't cut it."
19246,-3,0,"In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House."
19248,-3,-1,"I've had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but we've got to fix it."
19250,-3,1,He doesn't fix it for ten years.
19252,-3,-1,"And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it."
19257,-3,-1,"Well, let me say, first of all, I'd be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the '83 Social Security commission."
19259,-3,1,I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system.
19260,-3,1,My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare.
19269,-3,-1,"Well, the people need it, that's the point."
19270,-3,-1,This is not a Wall Street tax cut.
19273,-3,0,"Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it's not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that's four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it's may be three or four months of mortgage payments."
19275,-3,1,"First of all, it's a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated."
19276,-3,1,"He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote."
19277,-3,-1,It's balancing a budget by the year 2002.
19279,-3,-1,So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities.
19284,-3,0,"In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we've got a case here."
19286,-3,-1,"It's a good package, Mr. President."
19289,-3,1,"Well, here's the problem with it: It sounds very good, but there's a reason that 500 economists, including seven Nobel prize winners and business periodicals like Business Week, and even Senator Dole's friends, Senator Warren Rudman, former Republican senator from New Hampshire, says it's not a practical program."
19290,-3,1,"It's a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans."
19292,-3,-1,We worked too hard to lower it.
19293,-3,1,"It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year."
19294,-3,-1,"So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, that's the right way to go."
19296,-3,-1,"I want to increase spending 14 percent, that's how simple it is."
19298,-3,1,"We're talking about six percentage points over six years, and with that money you give it back to the working people."
19299,-3,-1,You also provide opportunity scholarships so low income parents will have the same choice that others have in sending their children to better schools.
19300,-3,-1,"It will work, and when it does work, Mr. President, I know you'll congratulate me."
19306,-3,0,And I told the people exactly what the Congress exactly what kind of bill I would sign.
19308,-3,-1,"Now, let me just give you an example."
19309,-3,1,"I had a person in the Oval Office who lost a child in a school bus accident where a drunk driver caused the accident directly, but there were problems with the school bus."
19311,-3,1,"Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery."
19312,-3,-1,I thought that was wrong.
19317,-3,-1,Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it's right for the country over the long run.
19318,-3,-1,That's what I've tried to do and that's what I will continue to do as president.
19321,-3,-1,"Well, I don't know in the case of the trial lawyers."
19322,-3,-1,"I look at the trial lawyers, and when you're a few million short, you run out to Hollywood and pick up two to four million and organized labor comes to Washington, D.C. and puts 35 million into the pot."
19325,-3,0,"The trial lawyers and I don't -- you know, my wife's a lawyer."
19329,-3,-1,But it seemed to me there's got to be some end to the frivolous lawsuits and there's got to be some cap on punitive damage.
19330,-3,-1,You're putting a lot of business people out of business.
19331,-3,1,"Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America."
19334,-3,-1,"And it seems to me that there is a problem there, Mr. President."
19338,-3,1,"Let me say, first of all, I signed a tort reform bill that dealt with civilian aviation a couple of years ago."
19340,-3,1,"Secondly, Senator Dole had some pretty harsh comments about special interest money, but it wasn't me who opposed what we tried to do to save the lives of children who were subject to tobacco and then went to the tobacco growers and bragged about standing up for the Federal government when we tried to stop the advertising, marketing, and sales of tobacco to children."
19345,-3,-1,I think Senator Dole and I just honestly disagree.
19347,-3,-1,I think it's very difficult.
19349,-3,-1,That's why we need campaign finance reform.
19350,-3,-1,That's why I reach out to the Perot voters.
19352,-3,-1,And the Perot voters that are looking for a home ought to take a look at the Republican record.
19354,-3,0,"I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup."
19356,-3,1,"He appointed three people, I appointed three people to get campaign finance reform."
19359,-3,0,We have a commission on campaign finance reform.
19365,-3,-1,But I want to go back to 1965.
19369,-3,1,All 50 states did it.
19370,-3,1,It took three and a half years.
19372,-3,1,"What about drugs that have increased, doubled in the last 44 months?"
19374,-3,-1,It seems to me that you have a selective memory.
19375,-3,-1,"You know, mine doesn't work that way."
19376,-3,-1,So I just want to try to correct it as we go along.
19377,-3,-1,"Mr. Lehrer, I hope we'll have a chance to discuss drugs later in the program."
19379,-3,-1,I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform.
19380,-3,-1,That was certainly the case from the minute I got there.
19387,-3,1,"So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have."
19388,-3,-1,"And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly."
19391,-3,-1,Get people who don't have any interest in politics but understand the issue and let them make the recommendation to Congress.
19392,-3,-1,"Now, we're now kidding anybody, Mr. President."
19394,-3,-1,Millions and millions of Americans.
19395,-3,-1,They know the Republican Party hasn't done it.
19397,-3,-1,We ought to agree that somebody else should do it.
19402,-3,-1,"Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what's happened."
19406,-3,1,"The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it."
19407,-3,-1,Let me tell you what I tried to do about it.
19408,-3,1,I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation's drug czar.
19409,-3,0,"The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired."
19410,-3,1,We submitted the biggest drug budget ever.
19412,-3,1,"We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins."
19413,-3,1,And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important.
19414,-3,-1,"Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don't understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you."
19415,-3,1,Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them.
19416,-3,-1,I think we all do.
19418,-3,-1,I don't think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don't think Senator Dole supports using using drugs.
19421,-3,-1,"Again, well it's, you are very selective, Mr. President."
19422,-3,-1,"You don't want to politicize drugs, but it's already politicized Medicare, go out and scare senior citizens and other vulnerable groups, veterans and people who get Pell Grants and things like this."
19424,-3,-1,But it seems to me the record is clear.
19428,-3,1,But here you cut the drug czar's office 83 percent.
19433,-3,-1,And we have a responsibility.
19435,-3,-1,Is that the kind of leadership we need?
19436,-3,-1,And I won't comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.
19440,-3,-1,That's what I thought we ought to do.
19442,-3,1,And you voted to cut services to 23 million school children under the safe and drug-free schools act.
19443,-3,-1,I don't think that means you're soft on drugs.
19445,-3,0,"But let me remind you, my family has suffered from drug abuse."
19450,-3,-1,Not if I didn't have a better idea.
19451,-3,-1,But I've got a better idea.
19453,-3,0,It's called the automated check or the instant check.
19454,-3,1,It's being used in 17 states right now.
19455,-3,-1,"States like Florida, Colorado, Virginia, and other states."
19456,-3,-1,You don't buy any gun.
19458,-3,1,"We've got 20 million names on a computer in Washington, D.C. of people who should not have guns."
19462,-3,-1,"You walk in, you put your little card in there."
19463,-3,-1,"If it says tilt, you don't get any gun."
19464,-3,-1,"You don't get a hand gun, you don't get a rifle, you don't get a shot gun, you get zippo."
19465,-3,-1,"If we're going to protect American children and American families and people who live as prisoners in their own home, we've got to stop guns from being dumped on the street."
19466,-3,1,The administration says they support the instant check.
19467,-3,1,"They've appropriated about $200 million, but only spent about $3 million to get it underway."
19468,-3,-1,"In our administration, in my administration, we will expedite."
19471,-3,-1,That is the bottom line.
19472,-3,-1,"And I believe it's a good idea, has strong bipartisan support."
19473,-3,-1,And perhaps that's another thing we can depoliticize.
19474,-3,-1,You talk about the Brady Bill.
19475,-3,1,There has only been one prosecution under the Brady -- only one under the assault weapon ban and only seven under the Brady Bill that you talk about all the time.
19476,-3,1,"And on the assault weapon ban, out of 17 weapons that were banned, only six banned now because eleven have been modified and are back on the street."
19481,-3,-1,But let's look at the facts here.
19482,-3,1,"The Brady Bill has kept at least 60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers from getting hand guns."
19483,-3,1,Senator Dole led the fight against the Brady Bill.
19493,-3,-1,"I mean, it seemed to me at the time the assault weapon ban was not effective."
19496,-3,-1,You're not going to worry about it anymore.
19499,-3,-1,"Let's stop, you know, playing the political game, Mr. President."
19500,-3,-1,Talking about this and this.
19501,-3,-1,"You add all the states that've used the instant check and how many weapons they keep, kept out of the hands of criminals."
19503,-3,-1,"So in my view, if you want to be protected, you ought to vote for Bob Dole and we'll get the instant check passed and we'll keep guns out of the hands of criminals."
19508,-3,-1,The United States is still the indispensable nation in the aftermath of the Cold War and on the brink of the 21st Century.
19512,-3,1,The integration of Central and Eastern European democracies into a new partnership with NATO.
19515,-3,-1,We have worked hard for peace and freedom.
19518,-3,1,Now there is a the democratically elected president in Haiti.
19520,-3,0,We just had the election there.
19523,-3,1,"The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, organized crime, and we have worked hard to expand America's economic presence around the world with the biggest increase in trade with the largest new number of trade agreements in history And that's one of the reasons America is number one in auto production again."
19525,-3,-1,"Well, I have a different view."
19527,-3,1,Now I understand it's been extended 'til some time next year.
19528,-3,1,"But, let's start with Somalia, where they dragged Americans through the streets, and where 18 Americans were killed one day, because they didn't have, they were pinned down for eight hours, the rangers."
19530,-3,1,They asked for the tanks.
19531,-3,1,They didn't get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building.
19535,-3,1,"You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago."
19537,-3,-1,So we need more protection from America.
19541,-3,1,"We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992."
19551,-3,1,"In Northern Ireland, in the Middle East we are better off than we were four years ago."
19552,-3,-1,There will always be problems in this whole world.
19553,-3,-1,"But if we're moving in the right direction and America is leading, we're better off."
19557,-3,-1,Now I think we have a selective engagement policy.
19558,-3,-1,"We have to determine when our interests are involved, not the United Nations' interests."
19561,-3,1,He's deployed more troops than any president in history around the world.
19562,-3,1,It's cost us billions and billions of dollars for peace-keeping operations.
19565,-3,-1,He makes that decision when he commits young men or young women who are going to go round and defend our liberty and our freedom.
19567,-3,-1,"Then I'm going to have a top down review at the Pentagon, not a bottom up review."
19569,-3,-1,"I want a top down review to determine what our priorities are and what we should do in defense, and then follow that policy instead of this bottom up review with all the services fighting for the money."
19570,-3,1,"You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion."
19571,-3,-1,Devastated states like California and others.
19573,-3,-1,We've got to go back and look.
19575,-3,-1,"You may have said that, too."
19577,-3,-1,"We provide the leadership and we're going to have to continue to provide the leadership, but let's do it on our terms when our interests are involved and not when somebody blows the whistle at the United Nations."
19580,-3,1,There is very little difference in the budget that I proposed and the Republican budget over the next six-year period.
19582,-3,1,"I have proposed a lot of new investments to improve the quality of life for our soldiers, for our men and women in uniform, for their families, for their training."
19583,-3,-1,That is my solemn obligation.
19584,-3,-1,You ask when do you decide to deploy them.
19585,-3,-1,The interests of the American people must be at stake.
19586,-3,-1,Our values must be at stake.
19587,-3,-1,We have to be able to make a difference.
19588,-3,-1,And frankly we have to consider what the risks are to our young men and women in uniform.
19591,-3,-1,When we've worked hard to end the Northern Korean nuclear threat.
19592,-3,-1,"I believe the United States is at peace tonight in part because of the disciplined, careful, effective deployment of our military resources."
19595,-3,1,You look at North Korea where they have enough plutonium to build six nuclear bombs.
19597,-3,1,"They lost about a million people in the war, the Korean War, the forgotten war."
19599,-3,-1,We shouldn't be doing any favors for North Korea.
19601,-3,0,We don't have any inspection.
19606,-3,1,"Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months."
19608,-3,-1,"The sooner the better off we'll be, if you put tougher sanctions on Castro, not try to make it easier for him."
19611,-3,1,"In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously."
19613,-3,1,Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space.
19614,-3,0,"They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation."
19616,-3,1,"I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they're effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba."
19617,-3,-1,And the United States needs help from other countries.
19618,-3,-1,Nobody in the world agrees with our policy on Cuba now.
19619,-3,-1,But this law can be used as leverage to get other countries to help us to move Cuba to democracy.
19621,-3,-1,"And if we stay firm and strong, we will be able to bring Cuba around as well."
19623,-3,-1,We have to be firm and strong.
19624,-3,-1,And I hope that will happen.
19626,-3,-1,We have not been firm and strong.
19627,-3,-1,You look at the poor people who still live in Cuba.
19629,-3,-1,"In my view, the policy has failed."
19633,-3,-1,And I think the people viewing out there ought to go back and take a look at the record when he fought a balanced budget amendment.
19634,-3,1,When he gave you that biggest tax increase in history; when he tried to take over your healthcare system.
19635,-3,1,"When he fought regulatory reform that cost the average family 6 to $7,000 a year."
19636,-3,-1,This is a serious business.
19637,-3,-1,"It's about your family; it's about your business, and in this case it's about a firmer policy with Cuba."
19638,-3,0,There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany.
19642,-3,-1,So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here.
19647,-3,-1,"I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we'll have a fairer and flatter system and we're going to make the economic package work."
19653,-3,-1,They're going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president.
19655,-3,1,"So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people."
19657,-3,1,The President held it up.
19658,-3,1,"And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn't satisfied with one provision."
19659,-3,1,But it will cover preexisting conditions.
19661,-3,-1,"So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government."
19664,-3,0,It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight.
19665,-3,-1,"Well, that sounds very good, but it's very wrong."
19667,-3,-1,And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the '94 elections so they could make that claim.
19668,-3,-1,"Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we're pursuing a step-by-step reform now."
19669,-3,1,The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family's been sick.
19670,-3,1,I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole's Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine.
19671,-3,1,"Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that -- my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums."
19673,-3,-1,"I think there's enough -- we're even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package."
19676,-3,-1,"In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food."
19682,-3,-1,"Well, I believe that we did the appropriate thing under the circumstances."
19683,-3,1,"Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens."
19684,-3,1,"Unfortunately, a lot of people, have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and we've been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now."
19685,-3,1,"What happened was one of the Turkish, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north, but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something."
19686,-3,-1,We did not feel that I could commit.
19687,-3,-1,"I certainly didn't feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that."
19688,-3,-1,So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors.
19689,-3,1,We did that by expanding what's called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies' control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad.
19690,-3,-1,Was it the right thing to do?
19693,-3,-1,Did it make him withdraw from the north?
19696,-3,-1,"We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do."
19699,-3,-1,I don't understand extending the no-fly zone in the south when the trouble was in the north.
19700,-3,1,"And what we've done during the Bush administration, the Kurds were at the State Department, negotiating, trying to work their differences out."
19701,-3,1,Now we've got all thousands and thousands of refugees.
19705,-3,-1,Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was.
19706,-3,1,"We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days."
19709,-3,-1,Did we have any allies helping?
19711,-3,-1,"They're always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that."
19715,-3,1,"The bottom line is, we went in there alone."
19718,-3,0,Senator Dole has two or three times before tonight criticized me for working with the U.N. Now I'm being criticized for not working with the U.N.
19723,-3,-1,It could reduce Saddam Hussein's abilities to threaten Kuwait and his other neighbors again.
19733,-3,-1,I want to be very serious.
19734,-3,1,I've supported the President when I thought he was right on Bosnia.
19739,-3,-1,"But it seemed to me just as an observer that you know before you'd call somebody to America, you'd have some notion what the end result might be."
19741,-3,-1,Maybe that was the purpose.
19745,-3,-1,"Now, to me that's not the strategy that I think people expect from America."
19746,-3,-1,"I think we have lost credibility, and I say this very honestly without any partisanship."
19754,-3,-1,The feelings are very strong.
19756,-3,-1,Prime Minister Rabin gave his life because someone in his own country literally hated him for trying to bring peace.
19757,-3,1,"I would like to have had a big, organized summit, but those people were killing each other, rapidly, innocent Arab children, innocent Israeli people, they were dying."
19759,-3,-1,"I felt that if I could just get the parties together to say let's stop the violence, start talking, commit to the negotiations, that would be a plus."
19760,-3,1,Now today the Secretary of State is in the Middle East and they've started negotiations and all those leaders promised me they would not quit until they resolved the issues between them and got the peace process going forward again.
19763,-3,1,The President has not called for an unconditional end to the violence.
19764,-3,-1,It seemed to me the violence stopped when these leaders came to America.
19769,-3,-1,I hope they talked and I hope they've reached some result and that the killing will end.
19774,-3,-1,And I think I know what he meant by that.
19777,-3,-1,That's why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again.
19779,-3,-1,That's why we're moving in the right direction.
19780,-3,-1,And I'm trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that.
19781,-3,-1,That's why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy.
19783,-3,-1,"That's why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again."
19786,-3,-1,I think this election has to be geared toward the future.
19787,-3,-1,"I think America's best days are still ahead, but we've got to build the right bridge."
19789,-3,0,"You know, the President reminds me sometimes of my brother Kenny, who is no longer alive."
19791,-3,-1,And he used to tell me things that I knew were not quite accurate.
19792,-3,-1,"So we always had a rule, we divided by six."
19793,-3,-1,Maybe in your case maybe just two.
19796,-3,-1,"He just liked to make it sound exager, a little better, made him feel better."
19797,-3,-1,"When it comes to bridges, I want a bridge to the future."
19798,-3,-1,I also want a bridge to the truth.
19799,-3,-1,We have to tell the truth.
19800,-3,-1,We've got people watching tonight and listening tonight trying to find the truth.
19801,-3,-1,"And the truth is, there is a lot wrong with America."
19802,-3,-1,"We need a strong economic package; we need a tax cut; we need the $500 child credit, and we'll have that soon."
19807,-3,-1,"But, you know, I think my ideas are better for the future."
19808,-3,1,"Senator Dole voted against student loans, against Headstart, against creating the Department of Education."
19810,-3,-1,"I personally don't think that's the right kind of future for America, and I think we ought to take a different tack."
19813,-3,-1,"I didn't favor it when it was in, started."
19815,-3,1,"It was a tribute after President Carter's election to the National Education Association who send a lot of delegates to the Democratic convention, who gives 99.5 percent of their money, Democrat Democrats, and the President, and a lot of the teachers send their kids to private schools or better public schools."
19816,-3,-1,So what we want to do is called opportunity scholarships.
19821,-3,-1,I'm not some extremist out here.
19826,-3,-1,And I try to do a lot of things that I think might be helpful to people.
19827,-3,-1,"So it seems to me that we ought to take that money we can save from the Department of Education, put it into opportunity scholarships and tell little Landale Shakespeare out in Cleveland, Ohio, and tell your mother and father, you're going to get to go to school because we're going to match what the state puts up, and you're going to go to the school of your choice."
19828,-3,-1,I don't fault the President or the vice president for sending their children to private schools or better schools.
19830,-3,-1,But why shouldn't everybody have that choice.
19831,-3,-1,Why shouldn't low income Americans and low middle income Americans.
19834,-3,-1,"Let me say first of all, I'm all for students having more choices."
19836,-3,1,"There's funds for 3,000 new schools created by teachers and parents, sometimes by business people, called charter schools that have no rules, they're free of bureaucracy and can only stay in existence if they perform and teach children."
19837,-3,-1,The ones that are out there are doing well.
19838,-3,1,What I'm against is Senator Dole's plan to take money away from all the children we now help with limited Federal funds and help far fewer.
19839,-3,-1,"If we're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be done at the local level or the state level."
19840,-3,1,But Senator Dole has consistently opposed Federal help to education.
19845,-3,-1,I'd better correct the President.
19850,-3,-1,"So I don't want anybody out there to think we've just been voting no, no, no."
19851,-3,-1,Let's give low income parents the same right that people of power and prestige have in America and let them go to better schools.
19857,-3,-1,"But if you're going to have a private voucher plan, that ought to be determined by states in localities where they're raising and spending most of the money."
19858,-3,1,"I simply think it's wrong to take money away from programs that are helping build basic skills for kids, 90 percent of them are in the public schools; to take money away from programs that are helping fund the school lunch program, that are helping to fund the other programs, that are helping our schools to improve their standards."
19861,-3,1,"And, Senator, I remind you that a few years ago when I supported teacher testing while in my home state I was pretty well lambasted by the teachers association."
19864,-3,1,"And let me just say that budget that you passed that I vetoed would have cut 50,000 kids out of Headstart."
19868,-3,1,That's one of the big reasons I vetoed it.
19869,-3,-1,"We need to be doing more in education, not less."
19870,-3,-1,"Well, the AmeriCorps program, I must say, if that's one of your successes, I wouldn't speak about it too loudly."
19871,-3,1,"It costs about $27,000 to pay people to volunteer."
19873,-3,1,"And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering."
19877,-3,0,You attended a private school for some time in your life.
19879,-3,-1,"You're not for school choice, you can't be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again."
19880,-3,1,"When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don't know what happened to the other .5 percent, we're looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats."
19882,-3,-1,You're for school uniforms and curfews and you're opposed to truancy.
19883,-3,-1,"Now that's not reform, Mr. President."
19884,-3,-1,Why can't Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school.
19886,-3,1,Some schools aren't even safe.
19888,-3,-1,"Let's give them a real choice, the kind of choice you had, and the kind of choice a lot of people have in America."
19890,-3,-1,"First of all, Senator Dole, let's set the record straight."
19896,-3,-1,I might say the results are highly ambiguous.
19903,-3,-1,"Now, I feel very strongly about a lot of things."
19904,-3,-1,I feel strongly about education.
19905,-3,0,"I want to help young people have an education, just as I had an education after World War II with the GI bill of Rights."
19906,-3,-1,We've had millions of young men and women in subsequent subsequent wars change the face of the nation because the government helped with their education.
19907,-3,-1,"Now the reason they don't have, The reason the President can't support this is pretty obvious."
19910,-3,-1,But this is a very liberal administration.
19914,-3,1,"This is the administration that fought the balanced budget amendment and vetoed a balanced budget and vetoed welfare reform twice, and the list goes on and on and on, that's what I had in mind."
19917,-3,-1,There will be people with experience and people who understand America and people who've made it and know the hard knocks in life.
19919,-3,-1,"And you know this liberal charge, that's what their party always drags out when they get in a tight race."
19920,-3,-1,"It's sort of their golden oldie, you know."
19921,-3,-1,It's a record they think they can play that everybody loves to hear.
19922,-3,-1,And I just don't think that dog will hunt this time.
19925,-3,1,We've got ten and a half million new jobs; we've got record numbers of those new small businesses.
19926,-3,1,We've made every one of them eligible for a tax cut.
19927,-3,1,"We've got declining crime rates, two million fewer people on welfare rolls before welfare reform passed, and a 50 percent increase in child support and a crime bill with 60 death penalties and 100,000 police and the assault weapons ban."
19928,-3,-1,The American people can make up their mind about whether that's a liberal record or a record that's good for America.
19929,-3,-1,"Liberal, conservative, you put whatever label you want on it."
19931,-3,-1,"You take a look at all the programs you've advocated, Mr. President."
19932,-3,0,Thank goodness we had a Republican Congress there.
19933,-3,1,"The first thing you did when you came into office was set up the stimulus package, said we've got a little pork we want to scatter around America, $16 billion."
19938,-3,1,"In any event, we saved the taxpayers $16 billion."
19942,-3,-1,I don't believe in discrimination.
19943,-3,-1,I believe you can protect the environment and grow the economy.
19948,-3,1,Their budget cut enforcement for the Environmental Protection Agency by a third.
19949,-3,1,"It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third."
19951,-3,-1,Their budget weakened our support for education.
19952,-3,1,"$30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans."
19953,-3,1,"Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women."
19954,-3,-1,It was wrong for the country and calling it conservative won't make it right.
19955,-3,-1,It was a bad decision for America and would have been bad for our future if I hadn't stopped it.
19957,-3,0,"Go back to the time he was, what, Texas director for George McGovern."
19958,-3,0,"George McGovern is a friend of mine, so I don't mean, but he was a liberal, proud liberal."
19959,-3,0,"I've just finished reading a book, I think it's called -- what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration."
19961,-3,-1,And so I think you take a look at it.
19962,-3,-1,"The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he'd recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what's going to happen to them."
19963,-3,-1,They've all got a lot of anxieties out there.
19964,-3,-1,Did anybody complain when you raised taxes?
19965,-3,-1,"Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money?"
19966,-3,-1,That's why we want an economic package.
19970,-3,-1,"The way you get a better America is to balance the budget and protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment; to give a targeted tax cut -- and let me talk about the education tax cut -- to let people have a $10,000 deduction for the cost of college tuition in any year, any kind of college tuition; to give families a tax credit, a dollar for dollar reduction in their taxes for the cost of a typical community college so we can open that to everybody."
19971,-3,-1,"And then to let people save in an IRA and withdraw from it without a tax penalty for education, home buying or medical expenses, that's the right way to go into the 21st Century, balance the budget and cut taxes, not balloon with this $550 billion tax scheme."
19974,-3,-1,"Let me say first, on the President's promise for another tax cut."
19979,-3,-1,"You've got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family."
19982,-3,-1,This is about American jobs and opportunities.
19983,-3,-1,"It's about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer."
19988,-3,0,"Well, my blood pressure is lower, my weight, my cholesterol, but I will not make health an issue in this campaign."
19990,-3,-1,But I think there are personal differences.
19991,-3,-1,"I mean, I'm not I don't like to get into personal matters."
19992,-3,-1,"As far as I'm concerned, this is a campaign about issues."
19994,-3,-1,And not about personal things.
19995,-3,-1,"You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past."
19996,-3,0,I know he wants to disown it.
19997,-3,1,"I wouldn't want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you're stuck with it because that's your record, that's your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history."
20000,-3,1,"Well, just for the record, when I was governor we had the lowest -- second lowest tax burden of any state in the country, the highest job growth rate of any state when I ran for president and were widely recognized for a lot of other advances."
20001,-3,-1,"But the important thing is, what are we going to do now."
20007,-3,1,"Now, remember, folks, even Senator Dole's campaign co-chair here, Senator D'Amato, says he's got to cut Medicare to pay for this."
20008,-3,1,"Everybody who's looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it's bad for the economy."
20010,-3,-1,"Our plan is better, it will take us into the future with a growing economy and healthier families."
20011,-3,-1,"Well, I'm really encouraged to know of your renewed friendship with Al D'Amato, and I know he appreciates it."
20013,-3,1,"It wasn't until we had a Republican Congress you even thought about, you talked about tax cuts."
20019,-3,-1,And hopefully in the next segment you could lay that to rest.
20021,-3,0,"Well, first of all, you know, he made that remark about Senator D'Amato."
20023,-3,-1,Let me say what I've said already about this pardon issue.
20027,-3,-1,"And that is what every president has done, as far as I know, in the past but what every other president's has done."
20028,-3,-1,This is something I take seriously and that's my position.
20029,-3,-1,But it seems to me the president shouldn't have any comment at all.
20030,-3,-1,Particularly where it's someone where you've had business dealings.
20031,-3,-1,"I mean, you may be sending a signal."
20033,-3,-1,"But as a President of the United States, when somebody asks you about pardons, you say no comment, period."
20034,-3,-1,And I think he made a mistake.
20037,-3,-1,"If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven't gotten into any of these things, as the President knows."
20043,-3,-1,"You know, so one of your liberal friends."
20050,-3,-1,"See, if I say anything it's going to be misconstrued."
20051,-3,-1,"I don't think there is even a race between the two, it's about our vision for America."
20055,-3,-1,But I respect the presidency.
20057,-3,-1,They all have their strengths and they all have their weaknesses.
20058,-3,-1,So I'd rather talk about my strengths.
20059,-3,-1,And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word.
20060,-3,-1,"It's a question between trust and fear, and I would say, I think, Mr. President, about all you've got going in this campaign is fear."
20064,-3,0,I have relatives on Medicare.
20067,-3,-1,And I'll keep my word on the economic package.
20070,-3,-1,That's what this race is all about.
20071,-3,-1,I'd like the American people to know that I have worked very hard to be on their side.
20073,-3,-1,But the most important thing is my plan for the 21st Century is a better plan.
20076,-3,-1,"Now we have to create those jobs, now that we're requiring people to go do work."
20077,-3,-1,A commitment to continuing step-by-step healthcare reform with the next step helping people who are between jobs to access healthcare and not lose it just because they are out of work for a while.
20079,-3,-1,That's what I'd like them to know about me; that I've gotten up every day and worked for the American people and worked so that their children could have their dreams come true.
20080,-3,-1,And I believe we've got the results to show we're on the right track.
20081,-3,-1,"The most important thing is, I believe we've got the right ideas for the future."
20083,-3,-1,We just see the world in different ways.
20084,-3,-1,And you folks out there are going to have to choose who you think is right.
20085,-3,1,"Well, I'd say the first homeless bill in the Senate was the Dole-Byrd Byrd-Dole bill, I can't remember who was in control then."
20090,-3,1,"President Clinton ran for governor in 1990 and said he's going to fill out his term, but he didn't."
20091,-3,-1,He's president so I guess it's a little better deal.
20094,-3,-1,"So I rolled the dice, I put my career on the line because I really believe the future of America is on the line."
20095,-3,-1,"We can give you all these numbers, they don't mean a thing."
20096,-3,-1,"If you are out of work, you have nothing to eat or you can't have medical care, or you're holding a crack baby in your arms right now, what do you do next?"
20101,-3,1,"When I ran for president, I said we'd cut the deficit in half in four years; we cut it by 60 percent."
20103,-3,1,"We're number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses."
20104,-3,1,"I said we'd put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that."
20105,-3,1,"I said we would change the way welfare works, and even before the bill passed we'd moved nearly two million people from welfare to work, working with states and communities."
20107,-3,1,I said that I would work for tax relief for middle class Americans.
20108,-3,-1,The deficit was bigger than I thought it was going to be.
20111,-3,1,"We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I've got a plan that's been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn't take that."
20115,-3,-1,"Well, there he goes again, that line has been used before, I mean, exaggerating all the things that he did."
20117,-3,-1,Let's take all these four years in a row.
20118,-3,-1,"He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn't like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress."
20120,-3,1,"And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work."
20124,-3,1,"The government's bigger than it was when President Kennedy was around, even though he says it's not."
20125,-3,1,"In addition, Republican Congress cut $53 billion."
20126,-3,-1,"So let's just, let's give credit where credit is due."
20129,-3,-1,"A lot of people ought to deserve credit, Mr. President."
20130,-3,-1,When I'm President of the United States we're going to have a governors' council and we're going to work directly with the governors to get power back to the people and back to the states.
20132,-3,1,But I believe that my plan is better than Senator Dole's ill-advised $550 billion scheme which I'll say again will blow a hole in the deficit.
20134,-3,-1,We have the right approach for the future and looks at the results.
20136,-3,-1,We are better off than we were four years ago.
20142,-3,-1,"Well, first, Jim, let me thank you and thank you, Senator Dole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen, all of you listening tonight for the chance you've given us to appear."
20143,-3,0,I want to say in the beginning that I am profoundly grateful for the chance that you have given me to serve as president for the last four years.
20144,-3,-1,"I never could have dreamed anything like this would come my way in life, and I've done my best to be faithful to the charge you've given me."
20147,-3,-1,And I've done my best tonight to lay out my plans for going forward to an even better future in the next century.
20148,-3,-1,I'd like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn't happen in this country.
20150,-3,-1,All the people I've met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children.
20151,-3,-1,And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way.
20152,-3,0,I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act.
20154,-3,-1,"Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it."
20156,-3,-1,"Thank you, Jim; thank you, Mr. President; thank everyone for watching and listening."
20157,-3,0,"I want to address my remarks to the young people of America, because they're the ones that are going to spend most of their life in the 21st Century."
20162,-3,1,And I would say to those I know there are more young people experimenting with drugs today than ever before; drug use has gone up.
20163,-3,-1,"And if you care about the future of America, if you care about your future, just don't do it."
20164,-3,0,And I know that I'm someone older than you.
20165,-3,-1,But I've had my anxious moments in my life.
20168,-3,-1,"I know who I am, and I know where I'm from, and I know where I want to take America."
20169,-3,-1,We are the greatest country on the face of the earth.
20170,-3,-1,"We do more good things for more people in our communities, our neighborhoods, than anywhere that I know of."
20173,-3,-1,"I ask for your support, I ask for your help."
20201,-3,0,I have actually not questioned Governor Bush's experience.
20204,-3,-1,I think this is a very important moment for our country.
20208,-3,-1,I believe we have to make the right and responsible choices.
20210,-3,-1,I will balance the budget every year.
20211,-3,-1,I will pay down the national debt.
20213,-3,-1,And I will cut taxes for middle-class families.
20214,-3,-1,I believe it's important to resist the temptation to squander our surplus.
20215,-3,-1,"If we make the right choices, we can have a prosperity that endures and enriches all of our people."
20219,-3,-1,"And I mean investing in education, health care, the environment, and middle-class tax cuts and retirement security."
20220,-3,-1,That is my agenda and that is why I think that it's not just a question of experience.
20228,-3,-1,"One-quarter of the surplus for important projects, and I want to send one-quarter of the surplus back to the people who pay the bills."
20231,-3,1,His plan is three times larger than President Clinton's proposed plan eight years ago.
20232,-3,1,"It is a plan that will have 200 new programs -- expanded programs and creates 20,000 new bureaucrats."
20234,-3,-1,Tonight you're going to hear that my passion and my vision is to empower Americans to be able to make decisions for themselves in their own lives.
20238,-3,-1,And let me give you an example of what I mean.
20240,-3,-1,"Now, I think those are the wrong priorities."
20243,-3,-1,I think it's very important to keep the debt going down and completely eliminate it.
20244,-3,-1,And I also think it's very important to go to the next stage of welfare reform.
20245,-3,1,Our country has cut the welfare rolls in half.
20247,-3,-1,"But it's now time for the next stage of welfare reform, and include fathers and not only mothers."
20249,-3,-1,Let me just say that obviously tonight we're going to hear some phony numbers about what I think and what we ought to do.
20250,-3,1,People need to know that over the next ten years it is going to be $25 trillion of revenue that comes into our treasurey and we anticipate spending $21 trillion.
20253,-3,-1,There is a difference of opinion.
20255,-3,-1,That's not what I think.
20263,-3,0,"Look, I fully recognize I'm not of Washington."
20266,-3,0,And I've been the chief executive officer of the second biggest state in the union.
20272,-3,1,"He spends more money for tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of his new spending proposals for health care, prescription drugs, education and national defense all combined."
20277,-3,-1,I hope it's about wealthy people.
20282,-3,-1,"Actually what I've said, Jim."
20283,-3,0,I've said that eight years ago they campaigned on prescription drugs for seniors.
20285,-3,1,And now they're campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors.
20288,-3,-1,And so what I've said is that there's been some missed opportunities.
20294,-3,0,"They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors."
20296,-3,-1,That's what I've been critical about the administration for.
20298,-3,-1,I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without.
20299,-3,1,"Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure there's a Social Security system around tomorrow."
20302,-3,1,"Well, Jim, under my plan all seniors will get prescription drugs under Medicare."
20304,-3,-1,"It's not, and let me explain the difference."
20306,-3,0,Your doctor chooses your prescription.
20309,-3,1,You fill the prescription and Medicare pays half the cost.
20310,-3,1,"If you're in a very poor family or if you have very high costs, Medicare will pay all the costs, a $25 premium, and much better benefits than you can possibly find in the private sector."
20318,-3,-1,We need to reform Medicare.
20320,-3,-1,"And so seniors will have not only a Medicare plan where the poor seniors will have prescription drugs paid for, but there will be a variety of options."
20321,-3,-1,"The current system today has meant a lot for a lot of seniors, and I really appreciate the intentions of the current system as I mentioned."
20322,-3,-1,If you're happy with the system you can stay in it.
20327,-3,-1,I believe we ought to make the system work better.
20329,-3,-1,"I know it will require a different kind of leader to go to Washington to say to both Republicans and Democrats, let's come together."
20336,-3,1,The governor has declined to endorse that idea even though the Republican as well as Democratic leaders in Congress have endorsed it.
20339,-3,-1,Now here is the difference.
20342,-3,-1,Let me give you one quick example.
20344,-3,0,"He's 70 years old, has high blood pressure, his wife has heart trouble."
20349,-3,-1,"I cannot let this go by, the old-style Washington politics, of we're going to scare you in the voting booth."
20352,-3,-1,"Instead of squabbling and finger pointing, he gets immediate help."
20356,-3,1,"They get $25,000 a year income, that makes them ineligible."
20357,-3,-1,"Look, this is a man who has great numbers."
20361,-3,-1,It's a scaring -- he's trying to scare people in the voting booth.
20363,-3,-1,The federal government should take no more than a third of anybody's check.
20364,-3,1,But I also dropped the bottom rate from 15% to 10%.
20365,-3,1,Because by far the vast majority of the help goes to people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.
20366,-3,1,"If you're a family of four in Massachusetts, making $50,000, you get a 50% cut in the federal income taxes you pay."
20377,-3,1,"If you make more than $25,000 a year you don't get a penny of help under the Bush prescription drug proposal for at least four to five years, and then you're pushed into a Medicare -- into an HMO or insurance company plan, and there's no limit on the premiums or the deductibles or any of the conditions."
20385,-3,-1,Let me make sure the seniors hear me loud and clear.
20386,-3,-1,They have had their chance to get something done.
20389,-3,-1,Let me call your attention to the key word there.
20394,-3,-1,"If we can get it done in the first year, you bet."
20406,-3,1,"My plan has not only a short-term component, but also a long-term component."
20408,-3,1,"Now, in the short-term we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price from OPEC when they want to raise the price."
20409,-3,-1,"And in the long-term we have to give new incentives for the development of domestic resources like deep gas in the western Gulf, like stripper wells for oil, but also renewable sources of energy."
20410,-3,-1,And domestic sources that are cleaner and better.
20418,-3,-1,"We have to bet on the future and move beyond the current technologies to have a whole new generation of more efficient, cleaner, energy technology."
20424,-3,-1,"Secondly, we need an active exploration program in America."
20426,-3,-1,You bet I want to open up a small part of Alaska.
20431,-3,-1,I want to develop the coal resources in America.
20437,-3,-1,I'm for doing something both on the supply side and production side and on the consumption side.
20440,-3,1,I worked to get $400 million just a couple of weeks ago.
20442,-3,-1,"Now, as for the proposals that I've worked for for renewables and conservation and efficiencies and new technologies."
20444,-3,1,They've only approved about 10% of the agenda I've helped to send up there.
20447,-3,-1,Well I would first say he should have been tackling it for the last seven years.
20452,-3,-1,Do we remove dams that produce hydroelectric energy?
20453,-3,-1,I'm against removing dams in the northwest.
20460,-3,-1,My answer to you is in the short-term we need to get after it here in America.
20461,-3,-1,We need to explore our resources and we need to develop our reservoirs of domestic production.
20463,-3,0,"I brought this up recently with Vincent Fox the newly elected president in Mexico, he's a man I know from Mexico."
20467,-3,-1,It's time for a new administration to deal with the energy problem.
20468,-3,-1,"If I may just briefly, Jim, note."
20470,-3,-1,"We may not find that many this evening, so I wanted to emphasize."
20473,-3,-1,"And also domestic exploration yes, but not in the environmental treasures of our country."
20479,-3,1,Less dependency upon foreign sources of crude is good for consumers.
20480,-3,-1,And we can do so in an environmentally friendly way.
20481,-3,-1,Well can I have the last word on this?
20488,-3,-1,I think what the next president ought to do is to promote a culture of life in America.
20491,-3,-1,"As a matter of fact, I think a noble goal for this country is that every child, born or unborn, need to be protected by law and welcomed to life."
20492,-3,-1,I know we need to change a lot of minds before we get there in America.
20494,-3,-1,I know we need to ban partial birth abortions.
20504,-3,-1,I hope the FDA took its time to make sure that American women will be safe who use this drug.
20508,-3,-1,This is indeed a very important issue.
20510,-3,-1,That's not the main issue.
20511,-3,-1,The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned.
20522,-3,-1,I don't think a president can unilaterally overturn it.
20528,-3,-1,Now that sounds to me a little bit different.
20529,-3,-1,I just think that we ought to support the decision.
20535,-3,-1,The voters should assume I have no litmus test on that issue or any other issue.
20537,-3,-1,People who will strictly interpret the Constitution and not use the bench to write social policy.
20538,-3,-1,That is going to be a big difference between my opponent and me.
20539,-3,-1,I believe that the judges ought not to take the place of the legislative branch of government.
20541,-3,-1,They shouldn't misuse their bench.
20542,-3,-1,I don't believe in liberal activist judges.
20543,-3,-1,I believe in strict constructionists.
20544,-3,-1,Those are the kind of judges I will appoint.
20553,-3,-1,It's very clear to me.
20568,-3,-1,"If you look at the history of a lower court judge's rulings, you can get a pretty good idea of how they'll interpret questions."
20572,-3,-1,I'll tell you what kind of judges he'll put on.
20583,-3,-1,"I think we should support the people of Serbia and Yugoslavia, as they call the Serbia plus Montenegro, and put pressure in every way possible to recognize the lawful outcome of the election."
20585,-3,1,Now he is trying to not release the votes and then go straight to a so-called runoff election without even announcing the results of the first vote.
20590,-3,-1,So we have to be intelligent in the way we go about it.
20591,-3,-1,"But make no mistake about it, we should do everything we can to see that the will of the Serbian people expressed in this extraordinary election is done."
20594,-3,-1,"Well, I'm pleased with the results of the election."
20596,-3,-1,It's time for the man to go.
20597,-3,-1,It means that the United States must have a strong diplomatic hand with our friends in NATO.
20608,-3,-1,"In this particular situation, no."
20611,-3,-1,"Now, I understand what the governor has said about asking the Russians to be involved, and under some circumstances that might be a good idea."
20614,-3,-1,I think that's the wrong thing.
20619,-3,-1,"Let me say this to you, I wouldn't use force."
20630,-3,-1,"Well, if it's in our vital national interests, and that means whether our territory is threatened or people could be harmed, whether or not the alliances are -- our defense alliances are threatened, whether or not our friends in the Middle East are threatened."
20631,-3,-1,That would be a time to seriously consider the use of force.
20633,-3,-1,Whether or not it was a clear understanding as to what the mission would be.
20637,-3,-1,I would take the use of force very seriously.
20639,-3,-1,I don't think we can be all things to all people in the world.
20640,-3,-1,I think we've got to be very careful when we commit our troops.
20641,-3,0,The vice president and I have a disagreement about the use of troops.
20643,-3,-1,I would be very careful about using our troops as nation builders.
20648,-3,-1,We're having trouble meeting recruiting goals.
20649,-3,1,"We met the goals this year, but in the previous years we have not met recruiting goals."
20651,-3,-1,I believe we're overextended in too many places.
20652,-3,-1,And therefore I want to rebuild the military power.
20659,-3,-1,Let me tell you what I'll do.
20660,-3,-1,"First of all, I want to make it clear, our military is the strongest, best-trained, best-equipped, best-led fighting force in the world and in the history of the world."
20661,-3,-1,"Nobody should have any doubt about that, least of all our adversaries or potential adversaries."
20662,-3,-1,"If you entrust me with the presidency, I will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure our forces stay the strongest in the world."
20664,-3,-1,"Now, I think we should be reluctant to get involved in someplace in a foreign country."
20666,-3,-1,"Now, just because we don't want to get involved everywhere doesn't mean we should back off anywhere it comes up."
20670,-3,-1,The question is will it be the strongest in the years to come?
20679,-3,-1,I'm going to rebuild our military power.
20682,-3,-1,"Well, they should look at our proposals and look at us as people and make up their own minds."
20683,-3,0,"When I was a young man, I volunteered for the Army."
20684,-3,0,I served my country in Vietnam.
20686,-3,0,"I went to college in this great city, and most of my peers felt against the war as I did."
20689,-3,0,I served for eight years in the United States Senate and served on the Armed Services Committee.
20691,-3,0,"Look, that's where World War I started in the Balkans."
20692,-3,0,My uncle was a victim of poisonous gas there.
20693,-3,0,Millions of Americans saw the results of that conflict.
20696,-3,1,The governor has proposed skipping the next generation of weapons.
20697,-3,-1,"I think that's a big mistake, because I think we have to stay at the cutting edge."
20699,-3,-1,I think you've got to look at how one has handled responsibility in office.
20702,-3,-1,Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is.
20703,-3,-1,We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today.
20707,-3,-1,I think that's an important part of leadership.
20708,-3,-1,I think what it means to build consensus.
20711,-3,-1,"And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and who's shown the ability to get things done?"
20712,-3,-1,If I could say one thing.
20718,-3,0,I was one of only a few Democrats in the Senate to support the Persian Gulf War.
20729,-3,1,"Look, we've got the biggest surpluses in all of American history."
20731,-3,1,"Almost half of all the tax cut benefits, as I said under Governor Bush's plan, go to the wealthiest 1%."
20733,-3,-1,"I think we have to invest in education, protecting the environment, health care, a prescription drug benefit that goes to all seniors, not just to the poor, under Medicare, not relying on HMOs and insurance companies."
20735,-3,-1,I think we've got to have welfare reform taken to the next stage.
20737,-3,-1,I think we need to put Medicare and Social Security in a lockbox.
20739,-3,-1,I don't think it should be used as a piggy bank for other programs.
20740,-3,-1,I think it needs to be moved out of the budget and protected.
20742,-3,-1,"Now, the priorities are just very different."
20748,-3,-1,The man is practicing fuzzy math again.
20750,-3,1,"Under Vice President Gore's plan, he is going to grow the federal government in the largest increase since Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1965."
20752,-3,1,"We're talking about adding to or increasing 200 programs, 20,000 new bureaucrats."
20753,-3,1,Imagine how many IRS agents it is going to take to be able to figure out his targeted tax cut for the middle class that excludes 50 million Americans.
20756,-3,0,50 million of you won't receive it.
20760,-3,1,"After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes then they do today, the poorest of Americans, six million families, won't pay any tax at all."
20763,-3,-1,"Let me just say, Jim, you haven't heard the governor deny these numbers."
20764,-3,-1,He's called them phony and fuzzy.
20765,-3,1,The fact remains almost 30% of his proposed tax cut goes to -- only to Americans that make more than $1 million per year.
20766,-3,-1,More money goes to the -- can I have a rebuttal here?
20770,-3,1,"Secondly, if you're a family of four making $50,000 in Massachusetts, you get a 50% tax cut."
20772,-3,0,"The Strunk family in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I campaigned with them the other day."
20774,-3,1,"Under my plan, they get $1800 of tax relief."
20776,-3,-1,Now you tell me who stands on the side of the fence.
20777,-3,-1,You ask the Strunks whose plan makes more sense.
20779,-3,-1,He would rather spend the family's $1800 and I would rather the Strunks spend their own money.
20781,-3,-1,"No, I don't, and I'm not going to go to calling names on his facts."
20782,-3,-1,I'm just gonna tell you what the real facts are.
20784,-3,1,"And if you just add the numbers up, he still hasn't denied it, he spends more money on a tax cut for the wealthiest 1% than all his new proposals for prescription drugs, healthcare, education, and national defense combined."
20786,-3,1,$665 billion over ten years for the wealthiest 1%.
20789,-3,-1,Let me give you some specific examples.
20790,-3,-1,"I believe college tuition up to $10,000 per year ought to be tax deductible so middle-class families can choose to send their children to college."
20792,-3,-1,I believe parents ought to be able to make more choices need more public and charter school choice to send their kids always to a safe school.
20793,-3,-1,We need to make education the number one priority in our country and treat teachers like the professionals that they are.
20796,-3,1,This is a man whose plan excludes 50 million Americans.
20798,-3,-1,Take for example the marriage penalty.
20803,-3,-1,I want my fellow Americans to hear one more time.
20807,-3,-1,"I want to say something, Jim."
20810,-3,1,"If you're a single mother making $22,000 a year and you have two children, under this tax code, for every additional dollar you make, you pay a higher marginal rate on that dollar than someone making more than $200,000 a year, and that is not right."
20811,-3,1,"My plan drops the rate from 15% to 10% and increases the child credit from $500 to $1,000 to make the code more fair for everybody, not just a few, not just a handful."
20812,-3,-1,Everybody who pays taxes ought to get some relief.
20820,-3,-1,"Let me give you a story about public education, if I might."
20821,-3,0,"It's about Kipp Academy in Houston, Texas."
20826,-3,0,It is a school full of so-called at-risk children.
20831,-3,-1,Here are the key ingredients.
20841,-3,-1,Here is the role of the federal government.
20842,-3,-1,One is to change Head Start to a reading program.
20843,-3,-1,"Two is to say if you want to access reading money, you can do so."
20845,-3,-1,"there must by K-2 diagnostic teaching tools, teacher training money, available."
20847,-3,-1,Let them reach out beyond the confines of the current structure to recruit teach-for-the-children type teachers.
20848,-3,-1,"Four, we're going to say if you receive federal money, measure third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade."
20850,-3,-1,"But if not, instead of continuing to subsidize failure, the money will go to -- the federal money will go to the parents for public school or charter school or tutorial or Catholic school."
20851,-3,-1,What I care about is children.
20863,-3,0,And I have budgeted for that.
20867,-3,0,"I got a letter today as I left Sarasota, Florida."
20869,-3,-1,We had a great time.
20875,-3,0,She's the 36th student in that classroom.
20876,-3,0,They sent me a picture of her in the classroom.
20882,-3,1,"The first is, the difference is there is no new accountability measures in Vice President Gore's plan."
20883,-3,0,He says he's for voluntary testing.
20885,-3,-1,You must have mandatory testing.
20890,-3,-1,Testing is the cornerstone of reform.
20891,-3,-1,You know how I know?
20894,-3,-1,We've done a long way working together to do so.
20895,-3,-1,The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility.
20898,-3,1,We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas.
20900,-3,-1,We need to expand education savings accounts.
20905,-3,-1,I think the governor may not have heard what I said clearly.
20909,-3,1,Governor Bush is in favor of vouchers which take taxpayer money away from public schools and give them to private schools that are not accountable for how the money is used and don't have to take all applicants.
20910,-3,-1,"Now, private schools play a great role in our society."
20911,-3,0,All of our children have gone to both public schools and private schools.
20913,-3,-1,Let me give you another example.
20914,-3,1,"I went to a school in Dade County, Florida where the facilities are so overcrowded the children have to eat lunch in shifts with the first shift for lunch starting at 9:30 in the morning."
20915,-3,1,"Look, this is a funding crisis all around the country."
20923,-3,1,"The governor, if it's a failing school, would leave the children in that failing school for three years and then give a little bit of money to the parents, a down payment on a down payment for private school tuition, and pretend that that would be enough for them to go out and go to a private school."
20929,-3,-1,I'm going to make the state do this and make the state do that.
20936,-3,-1,"Secondly, one of the things that we have to be careful about in politics is throwing money at a system that has not yet been reformed."
20937,-3,-1,"More money is needed and I spend more money, but step one is to make sure we reform the system to have the system in place that leaves no child behind."
20938,-3,-1,"Stop this business about asking gosh, how old are you?"
20939,-3,1,"If you're 10 we'll put you here, 12 you put here."
20940,-3,-1,"Start asking the question, what do you know?"
20951,-3,0,"I have been in public service for 24 years, Jim."
20953,-3,-1,"They have good people and they play constructive roles sometimes, but sometimes they get too much power."
20957,-3,1,They oppose mine because they don't want to get Medicare involved because they're afraid that Medicare will negotiate lower prices for seniors who currently pay the highest prices of all.
20959,-3,0,"I've been standing up to big Hollywood, big trial lawyers."
20965,-3,-1,I remember the floods that swept our state.
20980,-3,-1,"But what I would do first and foremost, is I would get in touch with the Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan, to find out all the facts and all the circumstances."
20981,-3,-1,"I would have my Secretary of the Treasury be in touch with the financial centers not only here, but at home."
20982,-3,-1,I would make sure that key members of Congress were called in to discuss the gravity of the situation.
20984,-3,-1,That's what governors end up doing.
20985,-3,-1,We end up being problem solvers.
20987,-3,-1,"In this case, in the case of a financial crisis, I would gather all the facts before I made the decision as to what the government ought or ought not to do."
20990,-3,0,I accompanied James Lee Witt down to Texas when those fires broke out.
20995,-3,1,"When the Asian financial crisis raised the risk of world-wide recession that could affect our economy, And now, of course, the euro's value has been dropping, but seems to be under control."
20997,-3,-1,But it's not good enough.
20998,-3,-1,My attitude is you ain't seen nothing yet.
21002,-3,-1,"There is a difference, though, as to what the economy has meant."
21004,-3,-1,I think most of the economic growth that has taken place is a result of ingenuity and hard work and entrepreneurship and that's the role of goverment to encourage that.
21005,-3,-1,"In terms of in response to the question, no."
21008,-3,-1,"You know, I think the American people deserve credit for the great economy that we have."
21011,-3,0,And now they had ingenuity eight years ago.
21019,-3,-1,We have got to do much more.
21020,-3,-1,"The key is job training, education, investments in health care and education, environment, retirement security."
21021,-3,-1,"And incidentally, we have got to preserve Social Security."
21032,-3,1,It's been projected that they could conceivably bust the budget by $900 billion.
21034,-3,1,"This is a plan that is going to increase the bureaucracy by 20,000 people."
21037,-3,-1,"If I could respond, Jim."
21040,-3,-1,In the reinventing government program you just look at the numbers.
21042,-3,-1,"Now, the fact is you're going to have a hard time convincing folks that we were a whole lot better off eight years ago than we are today."
21043,-3,-1,But that's not the question.
21044,-3,-1,"The question is, will we be better off four years from now than we are today?"
21046,-3,-1,I can't let the man continue with fuzzy math.
21049,-3,-1,I'm not going to be the kind of president that says you get tax relief and you don't.
21050,-3,-1,I'm not going to be a picker and chooser.
21051,-3,-1,What is fair is everybody who pays taxes ought to get relief.
21061,-3,-1,"Because if we can keep our prosperity going, if we can continue balancing the budget and paying down the debt, then the strong economy keeps generating surpluses."
21064,-3,-1,And the interest savings I would put right back into Social Security.
21065,-3,1,That extends the life of Social Security for 55 years.
21069,-3,-1,I don't go along with it.
21070,-3,-1,I am opposed to it.
21074,-3,1,"His leading advisor on this plan actually said that would be okay, because then the Social Security Trust Fund could start borrowing."
21075,-3,1,It would borrow up to $3 trillion.
21077,-3,-1,And I don't think it should do that.
21083,-3,-1,"For those of you who he wants to scare into the voting booth to vote for him, hear me loud and clear."
21085,-3,-1,You bet we want to allow younger workers to take some of their own money.
21096,-3,-1,That you can pass on from one generation to the next.
21100,-3,-1,If we're smart and if we trust workers and if we understand the power of the compounding rate of interest.
21103,-3,-1,My plan is Social Security plus.
21105,-3,1,Your future benefits would be cut by the amount that's diverted into the stock market.
21106,-3,-1,"If you make bad investments, that's too bad."
21111,-3,-1,"I would like to know from the governor -- I know we're not supposed to ask each other questions -- but I'd be interested in knowing, does that trillion dollars come from the trust fund, or does it come from the rest of the budget?"
21113,-3,1,There's enough money to pay seniors today in the current affairs of Social Security.
21114,-3,1,The trillion comes from the surplus.
21117,-3,-1,"It's not Social Security plus, it's Social Security plus huge debt."
21120,-3,-1,It's time to have a leader that doesn't put off tomorrow what we should do today.
21121,-3,-1,"It's time to have somebody to step up and say look, let's let younger workers take some of their own money and under certain guidelines invest it in the private markets."
21123,-3,1,That's twice the amount of rate of return than the current Social Security Trust.
21124,-3,-1,"It's a fundamental difference of opinion here, folks."
21127,-3,-1,"Seniors now understand that the promise made will be a promise kept, but younger workers now understand we better have a government that trusts them and that's exactly what I'm going to do."
21129,-3,-1,This is a big issue.
21130,-3,-1,Could we do another round on it?
21133,-3,1,"When FDR established Social Security, they didn't call them IOUs, they called it the full faith and credit of the United States."
21140,-3,-1,We need to make sure our seniors get the promise made.
21149,-3,-1,I felt like there needed to be a better sense of responsibility of what was going on in the White House.
21150,-3,-1,"I believe that -- I believe they've moved that sign, ""The buck stops here"" from the Oval Office desk to ""The buck stops here"" on the Lincoln bedroom."
21154,-3,-1,"I see it all the time when people come up to me and say, I don't want you to let me down again."
21155,-3,-1,And we can do better than the past administration has done.
21156,-3,-1,It's time for a fresh start.
21158,-3,-1,It's time for a fresh start after a season of cynicism.
21160,-3,-1,"You know, going to a Buddhist temple and then claiming it wasn't a fundraiser isn't my view of responsibility."
21163,-3,-1,"I want to spend my time making this country even better than it is, not trying to make you out to be a bad person."
21168,-3,0,We became grandparents a year-and-a-half ago.
21171,-3,-1,I will fight for middle-class families and working men and women and I will never let you down.
21176,-3,-1,I think people need to be held responsible for the actions they take in life.
21185,-3,-1,"I'm offering you my own vision, my own experience, my own proposals."
21186,-3,-1,"And incidentally, one of them is this."
21190,-3,-1,And I wish Governor Bush would join me this evening in endorsing the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance Reform Bill.
21194,-3,-1,"And so, look, I'm going to -- what you need to know about me is I will uphold the law, I'm going to have an attorney general that enforces the law."
21201,-3,-1,I would support an effort to ban corporate soft money and labor union soft money so long as there was dues check-off.
21202,-3,0,I've campaigned on this since the primaries.
21204,-3,-1,I think we need to fully enforce the law.
21205,-3,-1,"I think we need to have an attorney general that says if a law is broken, we'll enforce it."
21206,-3,-1,Be strict and firm about it.
21208,-3,-1,I think we ought to focus on the problems and not attack each other.
21210,-3,-1,We have to get a handle on it.
21213,-3,-1,"And anybody who thinks I'm just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress."
21215,-3,-1,I want people to hear what he just said.
21216,-3,1,He is for full public financing of Congressional elections.
21226,-3,-1,Mine is I want to empower people in their own lives.
21230,-3,-1,"It will require the ability of a Republican president to reach out across the partisan divide and to say to Democrats, let's come together to do what is right for America."
21233,-3,-1,I want to make sure prescription drugs are available for all seniors.
21234,-3,-1,And I want seniors to have additional choices when it comes to choosing their health care plans.
21235,-3,-1,I want to finally get something done on Social Security.
21239,-3,-1,I don't want to try to put our troops in all places at all times.
21241,-3,-1,I want anti-ballistic missile systems to protect ourselves and our allies from a rogue nation that may try to hold us hostage or blackmail our allies and friends.
21242,-3,-1,I want to make sure the education system fulfills its hope and promise.
21244,-3,-1,"I understand the limited role of the federal government, but it could be a constructive role when it comes to reform, by insisting that there be a strong accountability systems."
21246,-3,-1,I'm asking for your vote.
21254,-3,-1,And we have a very important decision to make.
21255,-3,-1,Will we use the prosperity to enrich all of our families and not just a few?
21257,-3,0,"Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for the working men and women of this country, middle-class families."
21262,-3,-1,"Make no mistake about it, they do have undue influence in Washington, D.C. and it makes a difference if you have a president who will fight for you."
21270,-3,0,She came all the way from Iowa in a Winnebago with her poodle in order attend here tonight.
21304,-3,1,"We've shipped millions of jobs overseas and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you've served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you've got good contacts and then go back out."
21307,-3,-1,We have got to stop sending jobs overseas.
21308,-3,-1,To those of you in the audience who are business people: pretty simple.
21311,-3,1,"Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care -- that's the most expensive single element in making the car."
21312,-3,-1,"Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement."
21313,-3,-1,And you don't care about anything but making money.
21314,-3,-1,There will be a job-sucking sound going south.
21315,-3,-1,If the people send me to Washington the first thing I'll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it's a 2-way street.
21317,-3,-1,"I decided I was dumb and didn't understand it so I called a ""Who's Who"" of the folks that have been around it, and I said why won't everybody go south; they said it will be disruptive; I said for how long."
21319,-3,-1,"And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive?"
21321,-3,-1,We got to cut it out.
21324,-3,1,"Carole, the thing that saved us in this global economic slowdown has been our exports, and what I'm trying to do is increase our exports."
21326,-3,1,"And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement -- and the prime minister of Canada, I might add -- and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas."
21327,-3,-1,"That's a scare tactic, because it's not that many."
21328,-3,-1,"But any one that's here, we want to have more jobs here."
21329,-3,-1,And the way to do that is to increase our exports.
21331,-3,-1,"I don't; I believe in free and fair trade, and that's the thing that saved us."
21333,-3,-1,I want to continue to work after we get this NAFTA agreement ratified this coming year.
21335,-3,-1,"And free and fair trade is the answer, not protection."
21339,-3,-1,The trick is to expand our export base and to expand trade on terms that are fair to us.
21340,-3,1,"It is true that our exports to Mexico, for example, have gone up and our trade deficit has gone down; it's also true that just today a record high trade deficit was announced with Japan."
21341,-3,-1,So what is the answer?
21342,-3,-1,Let me just mention three things very quickly.
21343,-3,-1,"Number one, make sure that other countries are as open to our markets as our markets are to them, and, if they're not, have measures on the books that don't take forever and a day to implement."
21347,-3,-1,"Emphasize and subsidize modernizing plant and equipment here, not moving plants overseas."
21349,-3,-1,So more trade but on fair terms -- and favor investment in America.
21358,-3,-1,And I'll tell you exactly why.
21359,-3,1,Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years.
21360,-3,-1,I'll tell you exactly what I think can be done.
21361,-3,-1,I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy.
21363,-3,1,"Mr. Perot will tell you, for example, that the expert he hired to analyze his plan says that it will bring the deficit down in 5 years but it will make unemployment bad for 4 more years."
21364,-3,-1,"So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy."
21365,-3,1,"I ask everybody to look at my economic ideas and 9 Nobel prize winners and over 500 economists and hundreds of business people, including a lot of Republicans said, this is the way you've got to go."
21366,-3,-1,If you don't grow the economy you can't get it done.
21367,-3,-1,"But I can't foresee all the things that will happen, and I don't think a president should be judged solely on the deficit."
21369,-3,-1,You'll have a shot at me in 4 years and you can vote me right out if you think I've done a lousy job and I would welcome you to do that.
21372,-3,-1,"You see, I don't think the American people are taxed too little."
21373,-3,-1,I think they're taxed too much.
21374,-3,1,I went for one tax increase and when I make a mistake I admit it.
21376,-3,1,"Governor Clinton's program wants to tax more and spend more -- $150 billion in new taxes, spend another $220."
21377,-3,-1,I don't believe that's the way to do it.
21378,-3,-1,Here's some thing that'll help.
21379,-3,-1,Give us a balanced budget amendment.
21380,-3,1,"He always talks about Arkansas having a balanced budget and they do, but he has a balanced budget amendment."
21382,-3,-1,I'd like the government to have that.
21383,-3,-1,"And I think it would discipline not only the Congress, which needs it, but also the executive branch."
21384,-3,1,"I'd like to have what 43 governors have -- the line item veto, so if the Congress can't cut, and we've got a reckless spending Congress, let the president have a shot at it by wiping out things that are pork barrel or something of that nature."
21389,-3,-1,It says to you as a taxpayer -- say you're going to pay a tax of 1000 bucks or something.
21391,-3,-1,"And if the Congress won't do it, if they can't get together and negotiate how to do that, then you'd have a sequester across the board."
21392,-3,-1,You'd exempt Social Security -- I don't want to tax or touch Social Security.
21393,-3,-1,"I'm the president that said hey, don't mess with Social Security, and we haven't."
21394,-3,-1,"So I believe that we need to control the growth of mandatory spending, back to this gentleman's question."
21395,-3,-1,That's the main growing thing in the budget.
21396,-3,-1,"The program that the president -- two-thirds of the budget, I as president never get to look at, never get to touch."
21397,-3,-1,"We've got to control that growth to inflation and population increase, but not raise taxes on the American people now."
21398,-3,-1,I just don't believe that would stimulate any kind of growth at all.
21400,-3,1,"Well, we're $4 trillion in debt."
21401,-3,1,"We're going into debt an additional $1 billion, little more than $1 billion every working day of the year."
21402,-3,-1,"Now, the thing I love about it -- I'm just a businessman."
21406,-3,1,But I just find it fascinating that while we sit here tonight we will go into debt an additional $50 million in an hour and a half.
21407,-3,-1,"Now, it's not the Republicans' fault, of course, and it's not the Democrats' fault."
21408,-3,-1,And what I'm looking for is who did it?
21410,-3,-1,"Now, the facts are we have to fix it."
21412,-3,0,"When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy I had multiple job offers."
21414,-3,1,People -- the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now.
21415,-3,1,"In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making -- 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000."
21417,-3,-1,And what's happened in the meantime?
21424,-3,-1,Somebody somewhere has to take responsibility for this.
21425,-3,-1,"Put it to you bluntly, American people."
21426,-3,-1,"If you want me to be your president, we're going to face our problems."
21427,-3,-1,"We'll deal with our problems, we'll solve our problems."
21429,-3,-1,"We'll pass on the American dream to our children, and I will not leave our children a situation that they have today."
21443,-3,0,"As you all know, I've been buying 30-minute segments to talk about issues."
21444,-3,0,"And tomorrow night on NBC, from 10:30 to 11 Eastern, we're going to talk about how you pay the debt down, so we're going to come right down to that one."
21445,-3,0,"We'll be on again Saturday night, 8 to 9 o'clock on ABC."
21446,-3,-1,So the point is --
21447,-3,0,"Like Jerry Brown, the 800 number."
21448,-3,-1,"-- I couldn't agree with you more, couldn't agree with you more."
21454,-3,-1,"Well, in the first place, I believe that character is a part of being president."
21455,-3,-1,I think you have to look at it.
21456,-3,-1,I think that has to be a part of a candidate for president or being president.
21457,-3,1,"In terms of programs, I've submitted, what, 4 different budgets to the US Congress in great detail."
21458,-3,-1,It's so heavy they'd give you a broken back.
21459,-3,-1,And everything in there says what I am for.
21462,-3,-1,"You know, nobody likes who shot John, but I think the first negative campaign run in this election was by Governor Clinton, and I'm not going to sit there and be a punching bag; I'm going to stand up and say, hey, listen, here's my side of it."
21463,-3,-1,But character is an important part of the equation.
21464,-3,-1,The other night Governor Clinton raised my -- I don't know if you saw the debate the other night.
21465,-3,-1,You did -- suffered through that?
21468,-3,0,"I remember something my dad told me -- I was 18 years old going to Penn Station to go on into the Navy, and he said write your mother -- which I faithfully did; he said serve your country -- my father was an honor, duty and country man; and he said tell the truth."
21471,-3,-1,"My argument with Governor Clinton -- you can call it mud wrestling, but I think it's fair to put it in focus is -- I am deeply troubled by someone who demonstrates and organizes demonstration in a foreign land when his country's at war."
21473,-3,-1,But that's what I feel.
21474,-3,-1,That's what I feel passionately about.
21476,-3,-1,How would he feel about it?
21481,-3,-1,You've got to say what you're for and you've got to --
21484,-3,-1,I don't want to --
21486,-3,-1,I don't want to --
21488,-3,-1,I get wound up because I feel strongly --
21491,-3,-1,Let me say first of all to you that I believe so strongly in the question you asked that I suggested this format tonight.
21493,-3,1,I also had a program starting last year.
21494,-3,-1,I've been disturbed by the tone and the tenor of this campaign.
21495,-3,-1,Thank goodness the networks have a fact check so I don't have to just go blue in the face anymore.
21496,-3,1,Mr. Bush said once again I was going to have $150 billion tax increase.
21497,-3,-1,"When Mr. Quayle said that all the networks said, that's not true."
21498,-3,1,He's got over $100 billion of tax cuts and incentives.
21499,-3,-1,"So I'm not going to take up your time tonight, but let me just say this."
21503,-3,-1,Please don't get into the Washington Post.
21505,-3,-1,Let's don't -- you don't have to believe it.
21507,-3,-1,I'm not interested in his character.
21508,-3,-1,I want to change the character of the presidency.
21509,-3,-1,And I'm interested in what we can trust him to do and what you can trust me to do and what you can trust Mr. Perot to do for the next 4 years.
21510,-3,-1,So I think you're right and I hope the rest of the night belongs to you.
21528,-3,-1,Let's talk about programs for children.
21534,-3,-1,I think it depends how you define it.
21535,-3,-1,"I mean, I think in general, let's talk about these issues."
21536,-3,-1,Let's talk about the programs.
21543,-3,-1,That's not specific in terms of a program.
21544,-3,-1,This is what a president has to do.
21545,-3,-1,"So in principle, though, I'll take your point and think we ought to discuss child care or whatever else it is."
21547,-3,0,Ross had his hand up.
21549,-3,-1,"Just no hedges, no ifs, ands and buts."
21551,-3,-1,So I'll take the pledge and will stay on the issues.
21553,-3,0,I don't have any speechwriters.
21557,-3,-1,"See, what you see is what you get and if you don't like it, you got two other choices, right?"
21559,-3,-1,"I want to say just one thing now, Ross, in fairness."
21561,-3,1,I've worked on these things for 12 years and I'm the only person up here who hasn't been part of Washington in any way for the last 20 years.
21563,-3,0,I worked 12 years very hard as a governor on the real problems of real people.
21564,-3,-1,I'm just as sick as you are by having to wake up and figure out how to defend myself every day.
21565,-3,-1,I never thought I'd ever be involved in anything like this.
21570,-3,1,And I don't have any foreign money in my campaign.
21572,-3,1,I don't have any PAC money in my campaign.
21577,-3,-1,I never got to say that.
21578,-3,0,"There's a great young group, Lead or Leave, college students, young people, who don't want us to spend their money."
21579,-3,-1,I took the pledge we'd cut it out.
21588,-3,-1,I'll be glad to take a shot at it.
21590,-3,-1,"I'm not sure that -- and I can understand if you haven't seen this, because there's been a lot of hue and cry."
21591,-3,1,We passed this year the most furthest looking transportation bill in the history of this country since Eisenhower started the interstate highways -- $150 billion for improving the infrastructure.
21592,-3,1,That happened when I was president.
21593,-3,-1,"And so I'm very proud of the way that came about and I think it's a very, very good beginning."
21594,-3,-1,"Like Mr. Perot, I am concerned about the deficits and $150 billion is a lot of money, but it's awful hard to say we're going to go out and spend more money when we're trying to get the deficit down."
21595,-3,-1,But I would cite that as a major accomplishment.
21596,-3,-1,We hear all the negatives.
21597,-3,-1,When you're president you expect this.
21598,-3,0,Everybody's running against the incumbent.
21601,-3,-1,But here's something that we can take great pride in because it really does get to what you're talking about.
21602,-3,1,Our home initiative -- our home ownership initiative -- HOPE -- that passed the Congress is a good start for having people own their own homes instead of living in these deadly tenements.
21605,-3,-1,And I need the help of everybody across this country to get it passed in a substantial way by the Congress.
21608,-3,0,I went to a boys' club.
21609,-3,-1,"And everyone of them -- the boys' club leaders, the ministers -- all of them were saying pass enterprise zones."
21610,-3,-1,We go back to Washington and very difficult to get it through the Congress.
21615,-3,-1,"And then you can sit down and say, help me do what we should for the cities."
21616,-3,-1,Help me pass these programs.
21618,-3,-1,"Sure, but the problem is, you get so many things included in a great big bill that you have to look at the overall good."
21619,-3,-1,That's the problem with our system.
21620,-3,-1,If you had a line item veto you could knock out the pork.
21625,-3,-1,This is not mud slinging.
21626,-3,-1,This is fact slinging -- a bill earlier this year.
21627,-3,-1,"This is facts -- that would have given investment tax credits and other incentives to reinvest in our cities, in our country."
21629,-3,1,Mr. Perot wants to do the same thing.
21631,-3,-1,"I mean, we agree with that."
21632,-3,-1,But let me tell you specifically what my plan does.
21633,-3,1,"My plan would dedicate $20 billion a year in each of the next 4 years for investments in new transportation, communications, environmental clean-ups and new technologies for the 21st century."
21635,-3,1,"There are 200,000 people in California, for example, who have lost their defense related jobs."
21637,-3,-1,"They ought to be engaged in breaking ground in other technologies, doing waste recycling, clean water technology and things of that kind."
21639,-3,1,"But we're investing a much smaller percentage of our income in the things you just asked about than all of our major competitors, and our wealth growth is going down as a result of it."
21641,-3,-1,We have to both bring down the deficit and get our economy going through these kinds of investments in order to get the kind of wealth and jobs and incomes we need in America.
21644,-3,-1,First you've got to have money to pay for these things.
21645,-3,-1,So you've got to create jobs.
21646,-3,-1,There are all kinds of ways to create jobs in the inner city.
21647,-3,-1,"I'm not a politician, but I think I could go to Washington in a week and get everybody holding hands and get this bill signed because I talk to the Democratic leaders and they want it."
21649,-3,-1,"But since they're bred from childhood to fight with one another rather than get results, you know, I would be glad to drop out and spend a little time and see if we couldn't build some bridges."
21651,-3,-1,The president can't order Congress around.
21653,-3,-1,"That's not bad for a guy that's never been there, right?"
21654,-3,-1,But you have to work together.
21657,-3,-1,"The president wants it, but we can't get it because we sit here in gridlock because it's a campaign year."
21659,-3,-1,That's another story that we're going to pay a big price for right after the election.
21660,-3,-1,The facts are though -- the facts are -- the American people are hurting.
21662,-3,-1,"We're shipping the quote, ""low paying jobs"" overseas."
21663,-3,-1,What are low paying jobs?
21664,-3,-1,"Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday's industries."
21665,-3,-1,They're tomorrow's industries in the inner cities.
21666,-3,-1,"Let me say in my case, if I'm out of work, I'll cut grass tomorrow to take care of my family; I'll be happy to make shoes, I'll be happy to make clothing, I'll make sausage."
21667,-3,-1,You just give me a job.
21672,-3,-1,"If you ask me if I could fly a fighter plane or be an astronaut, I can't."
21674,-3,-1,That's something I know how to do.
21677,-3,-1,You want jobs in the inner city?
21678,-3,-1,Do you want jobs in the inner city?
21683,-3,-1,"And, among other things, I would say, okay, over here in this Senate committee to the chairman who is anxious to get this bill passed, the president who is anxious, I'd say rather than just yelling at one another, why don't we find out where we're apart, try to get together, get the bill passed and give the people the benefits and not play party politics right now."
21684,-3,-1,And I think the press would follow that so closely that probably they would get it done.
21685,-3,-1,That's the way I would do it.
21686,-3,-1,"I doubt if they'll give me the chance, but I will drop everything and go work on it."
21695,-3,0,"I live in a state where over half the adults have hunting or fishing licenses, or both."
21696,-3,-1,"But I believe we have to have some way of checking hand guns before they're sold, to check the criminal history, the mental health history, and the age of people who are buying them."
21697,-3,1,"Therefore I support the Brady bill which would impose a national waiting period unless and until a state did what only Virginia has done now, which is to automate its records."
21698,-3,-1,"Once you automate your records, then you don't have to have a waiting period, but at least you can check."
21699,-3,-1,I also think we should have frankly restrictions on assault weapons whose only purpose is to kill.
21700,-3,-1,We need to give the police a fighting chance in our urban areas where the gangs are building up.
21701,-3,-1,"The third thing I would say -- it doesn't bear directly on gun control, but it's very important -- we need more police on the street."
21703,-3,-1,"I also believe that we should offer college scholarships to people who will agree to work them off as police officers, and I think, as we reduce our military forces, we should let people earn military retirement by coming out and working as police officers."
21705,-3,1,"In the communities which have had real success putting police officers near schools where kids carry weapons, to get the weapons out of the schools, are on the same blocks, you've seen crime go down."
21706,-3,1,In Houston there's been a 15- percent drop in the crime rate in the last year because of the work the mayor did there in increasing the police force.
21707,-3,-1,So I know it can work; I've seen it happen.
21710,-3,-1,I think you put your finger on a major problem.
21711,-3,-1,"I talk about strengthening the American family and it's very hard to strengthen the family if people are scared to walk down to the corner store and, you know, send their kid down to get a loaf of bread."
21714,-3,-1,"I've been fighting for changes in the exclusionary rule so if an honest cop stops somebody and makes a technical mistake, the criminal doesn't go away."
21715,-3,-1,I'll probably get into a fight in this room with some but I happen to think that we need stronger death penalties for those that kill police officers.
21716,-3,1,"Virginia's in the lead in this, as Governor Clinton properly said, on this identification system for firearms."
21717,-3,1,I am not for national registration of firearms.
21718,-3,1,Some of the states that have the toughest anti-gun laws have the highest levels of crime.
21719,-3,-1,"I am for the right, as the governor says- -I'm a sportsman and I don't think you ought to eliminate all kinds of weapons."
21722,-3,1,We've got more money going out for local police than any previous administration.
21725,-3,-1,"We have got to win our national strategy against drugs, the fight against drugs."
21727,-3,-1,We're not doing as well amongst the people that get to be habitual drug-users.
21728,-3,1,"The good news is, and I think it's true in Richmond, teenage use is down of cocaine, substantially, 60% in the last couple of years."
21729,-3,-1,"So we're making progress but until we get that one done, we're not going to solve the neighborhood crime problem."
21731,-3,0,I didn't get to make a comment on this.
21733,-3,-1,"Oh, you're going to let me."
21738,-3,-1,"I don't care what it is -- competitiveness, health care, crime, you name it."
21740,-3,-1,So why pass a law that won't fix it?
21745,-3,-1,"This is going to take first, building a consensus at grassroots America."
21746,-3,-1,"Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it."
21747,-3,-1,"And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans."
21748,-3,-1,"And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you're doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one."
21749,-3,-1,But don't just sit here slow dancing for 4 years doing nothing.
21755,-3,-1,I'll be glad to respond.
21757,-3,-1,I strongly support term limits for members of the US Congress.
21759,-3,0,"The president's terms are limited to 2, a total of 8 years."
21762,-3,1,"For 38 years one party has controlled the House of Representatives, and the result, a sorry little post office that can't do anything right and a bank that has more overdrafts than all the Chase Bank and Citibank put together."
21765,-3,-1,"And so I favor, strongly favor, term limits."
21766,-3,-1,And how to get them passed?
21767,-3,-1,Send us some people that will pass the idea.
21768,-3,-1,And I think you will.
21769,-3,-1,I think the American people want it now.
21770,-3,-1,"Every place I go I talk about it, and I think they want it done."
21774,-3,-1,"I know they're popular, but I'm against them."
21776,-3,-1,"I believe, number one, it would pose a real problem for a lot of smaller states in the Congress who have enough trouble now making sure their interests are heard."
21777,-3,-1,"Number 2, I think it would increase the influence of unelected staff members in the Congress who have too much influence already."
21778,-3,-1,"I want to cut the size of the congressional staffs, but I think you're going to have too much influence there with people who were never elected, who have lots of expertise."
21779,-3,-1,"Number 3, if the people really have a mind to change, they can."
21781,-3,-1,"Now, let me tell you what I favor instead."
21782,-3,-1,"I favor strict controls on how much you can spend running for Congress, strict limits on political action committees, requirements that people running for Congress appear in open public debates like we're doing now."
21784,-3,-1,"So that's how I feel about it, and I think if we had the right kind of campaign reform, we'd get the changes you want."
21787,-3,-1,Let me do first on a personal level.
21789,-3,-1,I do not intend to spend one minute of one day thinking about re-election.
21790,-3,-1,"And as a matter of principle -- and my situation is unique, and I understand it -- I would take absolutely no compensation; I go as their servant."
21791,-3,-1,"Now, I have set as strong an example as I can, then at that point when we sit down over at Capitol Hill -- tomorrow night I'm going to be talking about government reform -- it's a long subject, you wouldn't let me finish tonight."
21792,-3,-1,"If you want to hear it, you get it tomorrow night -- you'll hear it tomorrow night."
21793,-3,-1,But we have got to reform government.
21794,-3,-1,"If you put term limits in and don't reform government, you won't get the benefits you thought."
21796,-3,-1,So we need to do the reforms and the term limits.
21797,-3,-1,"And after we reform it, it won't be a lifetime career opportunity; good people will go serve and then go back to their homes and not become foreign lobbyists and cash in at 30,000 bucks a month and then take time off to run some president's campaign."
21798,-3,-1,"They're all nice people, they're just in a bad system."
21805,-3,-1,So let me try to answer you in this way.
21806,-3,-1,Let's start with a premise.
21807,-3,1,"We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people."
21808,-3,1,We have 35 million people without any insurance at all -- and I see them all the time.
21809,-3,1,A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years.
21810,-3,-1,"So if you analyze where we're out of line with other countries, you come up with the following conclusions."
21812,-3,-1,"So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody."
21813,-3,-1,"Employers would cover their employees, government would cover the unemployed."
21814,-3,-1,"Number 2, I think you have to take on specifically the insurance companies and require them to make some significant change in the way they rate people in the big community pools."
21816,-3,-1,I think you have to take on medical fraud.
21821,-3,-1,"To do that you need a system of managed competition where all of us are covered in big groups and we can choose our doctors and our hospitals, a wide range, but there is an incentive to control costs."
21823,-3,-1,"Now, let me say, some people say we can't do this but Hawaii does it."
21824,-3,1,"They cover 98% of their people and their insurance premiums are much cheaper than the rest of America, and so does Rochester, New York."
21827,-3,-1,"It's a big human problem and a devastating economic problem for America, and I'm going to send a plan to do this within the first 100 days of my presidency."
21831,-3,-1,I just have to say something.
21832,-3,-1,I don't want to stampede.
21834,-3,-1,I don't want anybody to stampede to cut the president's salary off altogether.
21836,-3,-1,"She asked a question, I think, is whether the health care profession was to blame."
21838,-3,-1,One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits.
21840,-3,1,"It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped."
21841,-3,-1,Doctors don't dare to deliver babies sometimes because they're afraid that somebody's going to sue them.
21843,-3,-1,So you can't blame the practitioners for the health problem.
21844,-3,-1,And my program is this.
21845,-3,-1,"Keep the government as far out of it as possible, make insurance available to the poorest of the poor, through vouchers, next range in the income bracket, through tax credits, and get on about the business of pooling insurance."
21846,-3,0,"A great big company can buy -- Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful."
21849,-3,-1,So I want to keep the quality of health care.
21850,-3,-1,That means keep government out of it.
21851,-3,-1,I want to do -- I don't like this idea of these boards.
21853,-3,-1,"I want competition and I want to pool the insurance and take care of it that way and have -- oh, here's the other point."
21854,-3,-1,I think medical care should go with the person.
21856,-3,-1,"You shouldn't be worrying if you get a new job as to whether that's gonna -- and part of our plan is to make it what they call portable -- big word, but that means if you're working for the Jones Company and you go to the Smith Company, your insurance goes with you."
21857,-3,-1,I think it's a good program.
21858,-3,-1,"I'm really excited about getting it done, too."
21860,-3,1,We have the most expensive health care system in the world.
21861,-3,1,Twelve percent of our gross national product goes to health care.
21866,-3,-1,You've bought a front row box seat and you're not happy with your health care and you're saying tonight we've got bad health care but very expensive health care.
21868,-3,-1,Go home and look in the mirror.
21869,-3,-1,"You own this country but you have no voice in it the way it's organized now, and if you want to have a high risk experience, comparable to bungee jumping, go into Congress some time when they're working on this kind of legislation, when the lobbyists are running up and down the halls."
21870,-3,-1,Wear your safety toe shoes when you go.
21871,-3,-1,"And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance."
21873,-3,-1,You're supposed to have a government that comes from you.
21874,-3,-1,"Now, there are all kinds of good ideas, brilliant ideas, terrific ideas on health care."
21875,-3,-1,None of them ever get implemented because -- let me give you an example.
21876,-3,0,A senator runs every 6 years.
21877,-3,1,"He's got to raise 20,000 bucks a week to have enough money to run."
21878,-3,-1,"Who's he gonna listen to -- us or the folks running up and down the aisles with money, the lobbyists, the PAC money?"
21883,-3,-1,"Now, you've got to have a government that comes from you again."
21884,-3,-1,You've got to reassert your ownership in this country and you've got to completely reform our government.
21885,-3,-1,And at that point they'll just be like apples falling out of a tree.
21887,-3,-1,"I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they're all ears, too, and listen to you."
21888,-3,-1,"Then you get what you want, and shouldn't you?"
21890,-3,-1,"Why shouldn't you get what you want, as opposed to what some lobbyist cuts a deal, writes a little piece in the law and he goes through."
21891,-3,-1,That's the way the game's played now.
21892,-3,-1,Till you change it you're gonna be unhappy.
21898,-3,-1,So I ask you to look at that.
21899,-3,-1,And you have to vote for somebody with a plan.
21900,-3,-1,That's what you have elections for.
21901,-3,-1,"If people would say, well, he got elected to do this and then the Congress says, okay, I'm going to do it."
21902,-3,-1,That's what the election was about.
21911,-3,-1,Who do you want to start with?
21913,-3,-1,It caused me to disrupt my private life and my business to get involved in this activity.
21914,-3,-1,That's how much I care about it.
21916,-3,-1,But I have lived the American dream.
21918,-3,-1,"Nobody's been luckier than I've been, all the way across the spectrum, and the greatest riches of all are my wife and children."
21919,-3,-1,That's true of any family.
21920,-3,-1,But I want all the children -- I want these young people up here to be able to start with nothing but an idea like I did and build a business.
21921,-3,-1,"But they've got to have a strong basic economy and if you're in debt, it's like having a ball and chain around you."
21922,-3,-1,"I just figure, as lucky as I've been, I owe it to them and I owe it to the future generations and on a very personal basis, I owe it to my children and grandchildren."
21925,-3,-1,"Well, I think the national debt affects everybody."
21927,-3,-1,Obviously it has a lot to do with interest rates --
21934,-3,-1,I want to think that they're going to be able to afford an education.
21935,-3,-1,I think that that's an important part of being a parent.
21937,-3,-1,Are you suggesting that if somebody has means that the national debt doesn't affect them?
21939,-3,-1,I'm not sure I get -- help me with the question and I'll try to answer it.
21946,-3,-1,"Well, listen, you ought to be in the White House for a day and hear what I hear and see what I see and read the mail I read and touch the people that I touch from time to time."
21948,-3,0,"It's a black church just outside of Washington, DC."
21951,-3,-1,"I mean, you've got to care."
21952,-3,-1,Everybody cares if people aren't doing well.
21955,-3,-1,"I don't think it's fair to say, you know, whatever it is, that if you haven't been hit by it personally."
21959,-3,-1,"But I think in terms of the recession, of course you feel it when you're president of the US."
21962,-3,-1,I'm glad you clarified it.
21964,-3,-1,Tell me how it's affected you again.
21966,-3,-1,You know people who've lost their jobs and lost their homes?
21969,-3,-1,I'll tell you how it's affected me.
21970,-3,1,Every year Congress and the president sign laws that make us do more things and gives us less money to do it with.
21971,-3,1,"I see people in my state, middle class people -- their taxes have gone up in Washington and their services have gone down while the wealthy have gotten tax cuts."
21973,-3,0,"When a factory closes, I know the people who ran it."
21976,-3,-1,What I want you to understand is the national debt is not the only cause of that.
21978,-3,-1,It is because we have not grown.
21980,-3,1,We've gone from first to twelfth in the world in wages.
21982,-3,1,Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago.
21984,-3,-1,"And this decision you're about to make better be about what kind of economic theory you want, not just people saying I'm going to go fix it but what are we going to do?"
21985,-3,-1,"I think we have to do is invest in American jobs, American education, control American health care costs and bring the American people together again."
21999,-3,-1,"Well, the Social Security -- you're an expert and I could, I'm sure, learn from you the details of the Pension Guarantee Fund and the Social Security Fund."
22001,-3,-1,So at least we have time to work with it.
22002,-3,-1,"But on all of these things, a sound economy is the only way to get it going."
22006,-3,-1,And that is very important.
22007,-3,-1,"But it's -- the full faith and credit of the US, in spite of our difficulties, is still pretty good."
22008,-3,-1,It's still the most respected credit.
22009,-3,-1,"So I would simply say, as these dates get close, you're going to have to reorganize and refix as we did with the Social Security Fund."
22010,-3,-1,And I think that's the only answer.
22011,-3,-1,"But the more immediate answer is to do what this lady was suggesting we do, and that is to get this deficit down and get on without adding to the woes, and then restructure."
22012,-3,-1,"One thing I've called for that has been stymied, and I'll keep on working for it, is a whole financial reform legislation."
22013,-3,-1,It is absolutely essential in terms of bringing our banking system and credit system into the new age instead of having it living back in the dark ages.
22014,-3,-1,And it's a big fight.
22016,-3,-1,And you can't just go up and say I'm going to fix it.
22018,-3,-1,But that's what the election's about.
22019,-3,-1,I agree with the governor.
22020,-3,-1,That's what the election's about.
22021,-3,-1,"And sound fiscal policy is the best answer, I think, to all the three problems you mentioned."
22024,-3,-1,"On the broad issue here, when you're trying to solve a problem, you get the best plans."
22025,-3,-1,You have a raging debate about those plans.
22026,-3,-1,"Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus."
22028,-3,-1,"Like the old carpenter says measure twice, cut once."
22029,-3,-1,Let's make sure this thing's as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting.
22031,-3,-1,"Anybody that's ever built a successful business will tell you you optimize, optimize, optimize after you've put something into effect."
22032,-3,1,The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them.
22033,-3,-1,Everybody knows how to fix them.
22036,-3,1,"See, we've got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less."
22037,-3,-1,"Now, that's another thing for you to think about when you go home tonight."
22038,-3,-1,You don't finance long-term debt with short-term money.
22039,-3,-1,Why did our government do it?
22040,-3,-1,To get the interest rates down.
22041,-3,1,A 1% increase in interest rates in that $2.8 trillion is $28 billion a year.
22044,-3,1,We are not investing that surplus like a pension fund.
22047,-3,-1,"That's because it comes at you, not from you."
22051,-3,-1,Do you want to fix the problem or sound-bite it?
22052,-3,-1,"I understand the importance of time but see, here's how we get to this mess we're in."
22054,-3,0,This is just 1 of 1000.
22060,-3,-1,That is priority one in this country.
22062,-3,-1,"And I'd love to be out of workers and have to import them, like some of our international competitors."
22073,-3,-1,I think I remember the question.
22075,-3,-1,"Let me say first of all, I want to answer your specific question but first of all, we all agree that there should be a growing economy."
22076,-3,-1,What you have to decide is who's got the best economic plan.
22078,-3,-1,So I don't want you to read my lips and I sure don't want you to read his.
22080,-3,-1,"Now, specifically, one, on Medicare, it is not true that everyone knows how to fix it."
22082,-3,-1,"I am convinced, having studied health care for a year hard and talking to hundreds and hundreds of people all across America, that you cannot control the cost of Medicare until you control the cost of private health care and public health care, with managed competition, ceiling on cost, and radical reorganization of the insurance markets."
22083,-3,-1,You've got to do that; we got to get those costs down.
22084,-3,1,"Number 2, with regard to Social Security, that program -- a lot of you may not know this -- it produces a $70 billion surplus a year."
22085,-3,1,Social Security is in surplus $70 billion.
22086,-3,1,"Six increases in the payroll tax -- that means people with incomes of $51,000 a year or less pay a disproportionally high share of the federal tax burden, which is why I want some middle-class tax relief."
22087,-3,-1,What do we have to do?
22089,-3,-1,"Number 3, on the pension funds, I don't know as much about it, but I will say this."
22090,-3,-1,"What I would do is to bring in the pension experts of the country, take a look at it, and strengthen the pension requirements further, because it's not just enough to have the guarantee."
22092,-3,-1,We had a guarantee -- and what happened?
22099,-3,-1,"Well, we have come to that position."
22100,-3,1,"Since I became president, 43, 44 countries have gone democratic, no longer totalitarian, no longer living under dictatorship or communist rule."
22102,-3,-1,New world order to me means freedom and democracy.
22103,-3,-1,"I think we will have a continuing responsibility, as the only remaining superpower, to stay involved."
22104,-3,-1,"If we pull back in some isolation and say we don't have to do our share, or more than our share, anymore, I believe you are going to just ask for conflagration that we'll get involved in the future."
22107,-3,-1,And you hear all the bad stuff that's happened on my watch; I hope people will recognize that this is something pretty good for mankind.
22108,-3,-1,I hope they'll think it's good that democracy and freedom is on the move.
22109,-3,-1,"And we're going to stay engaged, as long as I'm president, working to improve things."
22112,-3,1,Right this very minute we're sending supplies in to help these little starving kids in Somalia.
22113,-3,1,It's the US that's taken the lead in humanitarian aid into Bosnia.
22116,-3,-1,And I think I got a good plan to help fix those problems at home.
22117,-3,-1,"But because of our leadership, because we didn't listen to the freeze -- the nuclear-freeze group, do you remember -- freeze it, back in the late 70s -- freeze, don't touch it; we're going to lock it in now or else we'll have war."
22120,-3,1,"The Soviet Union is no more, and now we're working to help them become totally democratic through the Freedom Support Act that I led on, a great Democratic ambassador, Bob Strauss, over there, Jim Baker, all of us got this thing passed -- through cooperation, Ross -- it worked with cooperation, and you're for that, I'm sure, helping Russia become democratic."
22121,-3,-1,"So the new world order to me means freedom and democracy, keep engaged, do not pull back into isolation."
22124,-3,-1,And only the US could do this.
22130,-3,1,All the nuclear weapons are not dismantled.
22131,-3,-1,"I am particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, the ones that can hit us."
22132,-3,-1,"We've got agreements, but they are still there."
22134,-3,-1,So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism.
22135,-3,-1,We have to have money to do that.
22136,-3,-1,We have to have our people at work.
22138,-3,-1,I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we've got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia.
22139,-3,-1,We cannot be the policeman for the world any longer.
22140,-3,1,We spent $300 billion a year defending the world.
22141,-3,1,Germany and Japan spend around $30 billion a piece.
22142,-3,-1,If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry that's a home run for me.
22143,-3,-1,Coming out of World War II it made sense.
22144,-3,-1,"Now, the other superpowers need to do their part."
22145,-3,-1,I'll close on this point.
22147,-3,-1,"If we're not an economic superpower, we're a used to be and we will no longer be a force for good throughout the world."
22148,-3,-1,And if nothing else gets you excited about rebuilding our industrial base maybe that will because job one is to put our people back to work.
22152,-3,-1,I'd rather answer her question first and then I'll be glad to.
22153,-3,-1,Because the question you ask is important.
22155,-3,1,"Winds of freedom blowing around the world, Russia demilitarizing."
22156,-3,-1,And it also requires us to maintain some continuity -- some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles.
22157,-3,-1,And I would just say there are three things that I would like to say -- number one -- we do have to maintain the world's strongest defense.
22158,-3,-1,We may differ about what the elements of that are.
22160,-3,-1,I think we're going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
22161,-3,-1,Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics.
22164,-3,-1,We have to be the strongest economic power in the world.
22165,-3,-1,"That's what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy."
22167,-3,-1,"We can't impose it, but we need to nourish it and that's the kind of thing that I would do as president -- follow those three commitments into the future."
22178,-3,-1,You can't do it with the school bureaucracy controlling everything and that's why we have a new program that I hope people have heard about.
22179,-3,1,"It's being worked now in 1700 communities -- bypassed Congress on this one, Ross -- 1700 communities across the country."
22181,-3,-1,"And it literally says to the communities, re-invent the schools, not just the bricks and mortar but the curriculum and everything else."
22184,-3,-1,"And so I believe that we've got to get the power in the hands of the teachers, not the teachers' union."
22188,-3,1,And it works- -it works in Milwaukee.
22192,-3,-1,So we've got to innovate through school choice.
22194,-3,-1,But she is absolutely right.
22195,-3,-1,The programs that we've been trying where you control everything and mandate it from Washington don't work.
22196,-3,-1,The governors -- and I believe Governor Clinton was in on this -- but maybe -- I don't want to invoke him here.
22198,-3,-1,We know better how to do it in California or Texas or wherever it is.
22199,-3,-1,So this is what our program is all about.
22200,-3,-1,"And I believe you're right on to something, that if we don't change the education we're not going to be able to compete."
22202,-3,-1,But it isn't going to get the job done if we don't change K through 12.
22207,-3,-1,But let me start with what you said.
22208,-3,-1,"I agree with some of what Mr. Bush said, but it's nowhere near enough."
22210,-3,-1,"Nobody running can promise that, there's too much change in the world."
22211,-3,-1,So what should we do?
22212,-3,-1,"Let me reel some things off real quick, because you said you wanted specifics."
22213,-3,-1,"Number one, under my program we would provide matching funds to states to teach everybody with a job to read in the next 5 years and give everybody with a job the chance to get a high school diploma, in big places on the job."
22214,-3,-1,"Number 2, we would provide 2-year apprenticeship programs to high school graduates who don't go to college."
22217,-3,-1,They could borrow the money and pay it back as a percentage of their income or with a couple of years of service to our nation here at home.
22218,-3,-1,"Number 4, we would fully fund the Head Start program to get little kids off to a good start."
22220,-3,-1,I don't think we should spend tax money on private schools.
22221,-3,-1,"But I favor public school choice, and I favor radical decentralization in giving more power to better-trained principals and teachers with parent councils to control their schools."
22228,-3,1,So the net cost would be 8 billion 6 years from now in a trillion-plus budget -- not very much.
22230,-3,1,The Head Start program full funding would cost about 5 billion more.
22235,-3,-1,"Yes, I've got scars to show for being around education reform."
22236,-3,-1,"And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children."
22238,-3,-1,And the children get lost in the process.
22240,-3,1,"Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world -- 199 billion a year -- and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement."
22241,-3,-1,One more time you've bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance.
22242,-3,-1,This is a government that is not serving you.
22243,-3,-1,"By and large it should be local -- the more local, the better."
22245,-3,-1,"The best people in a small town will serve on the school board; you get into big cities, it's political patronage, stepping stones -- you get the job, give your relatives a janitor's job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make, and with luck they clean the cafeteria once a week."
22246,-3,-1,"Now, you're paying for that."
22247,-3,-1,Those schools belong to you.
22249,-3,-1,"Now, as long as we put up with that, that's what you're going to get."
22251,-3,-1,"If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home -- nothing will ever replace that."
22252,-3,-1,"You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that?"
22253,-3,-1,"Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day."
22254,-3,-1,There's nothing -- the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit.
22257,-3,-1,In a little school everybody is somebody; individualism is very important.
22261,-3,-1,5000 students -- why is a high school that big?
22264,-3,-1,"Now, that has nothing to do with learning."
22266,-3,1,In Texas you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows.
22269,-3,-1,That's the only way we got him back.
22270,-3,-1,"(Laughter) Now, that's your tax money being wasted."
22272,-3,-1,It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town.
22273,-3,-1,"And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage."
22274,-3,-1,"At the end of the first day, that little child wants out."
22277,-3,-1,"If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn't want to go back the second day."
22278,-3,-1,I don't have time to tell you the stories.
22280,-3,-1,"Finally, if we don't fix this, you're right."
22283,-3,-1,Cheapest money you'll ever spend.
22289,-3,-1,And in the first few years they either learn how to learn or don't learn how to learn.
22290,-3,-1,"And if they don't, they wind up in prison."
22298,-3,-1,It does what the GI Bill itself did when I came out of World War II.
22301,-3,-1,So I think it's worth a shot.
22303,-3,-1,It ought to be tried.
22304,-3,-1,"School choice -- public, private or religious."
22305,-3,1,"Not to the schools but to -- you know, 46% of the teachers in Chicago, public school teachers, send their kids to private school."
22306,-3,-1,"Now, I think we ought to try to help families and see if it will do what I think -- make all schools better."
22307,-3,-1,I just want to mention if I could --
22310,-3,-1,"Including the parents in the preschool education of their kids, even if they're poor and uneducated, can make a huge difference."
22312,-3,-1,It's the most successful thing we've ever done.
22313,-3,-1,Just a fact clarification real quickly.
22314,-3,1,We do not spend a higher percentage of our income on public education than every other country.
22318,-3,-1,"There are great public schools where there's public school choice, accountability and brilliant principals."
22330,-3,1,More and more women are being elected.
22332,-3,-1,"And you know, according to my mother and my wife and my daughter, this world would be a lot better place if women were running it most of the time."
22338,-3,-1,So I think it would be a good thing for America if it happened.
22345,-3,-1,I think if Barbara Bush were running this year she'd be elected.
22347,-3,-1,"(Laughter) You don't want us to mention appointees, but when you see the quality of people in our administration, see how Colin Powell performed -- I say administration --"
22349,-3,-1,You weren't impressed with the fact that he --
22361,-3,-1,I don't know -- starting after 4 years.
22363,-3,-1,"No, I think you'll see --"
22365,-3,-1,I think you'll see more minority candidates and women candidates coming forward.
22368,-3,-1,Let's see how they do.
22372,-3,-1,A message just won't do it.
22377,-3,-1,"Now, if won't be, General Waller would be -- you say, why do you keep picking military people."
22378,-3,0,These are people that I just happen to know and have a high regard for.
22380,-3,-1,How about Dr. Lou Sullivan?
22389,-3,-1,I can think of many.
22408,-3,-1,(Applause) But don't take it out of my time!
22411,-3,-1,I feel strongly about it because I don't want it to come out of my time.
22414,-3,0,"No, but let me just stay to the American people in 2 and a half weeks we're going to choose who should sit in this Oval Office, who to lead the economic recovery, who to be the leader of the free world, who to get the deficit down."
22415,-3,-1,three ways to do that.
22416,-3,-1,One is to raise taxes.
22421,-3,-1,I'm just not going to do that.
22422,-3,-1,I do believe that we need to control mandatory spending.
22423,-3,-1,I think we need to invest and save more.
22424,-3,-1,I believe that we need to educate better and retrain better.
22425,-3,-1,I believe that we need to export more so I'll keep working for export agreements where we can sell more abroad and I believe that we must strengthen the family.
22427,-3,-1,"Now, let me pose this question to America."
22428,-3,-1,"If in the next 5 minutes a television announcer came on and said, there is a major international crisis -- there is a major threat to the world or in this country a major threat -- my question is, who, if you were appointed to name 1 of the 3 of us, who would you choose?"
22429,-3,-1,"Who has the perseverance, the character, the integrity, the maturity, to get the job done?"
22430,-3,-1,I hope I'm that person.
22431,-3,-1,"Thank you very, very much."
22434,-3,-1,"If the American people want to do it and not talk about it, then they ought to -- you know, I'm one person they ought to consider."
22435,-3,-1,"If they just want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man."
22440,-3,-1,Everybody says you can't do that with Congress.
22441,-3,-1,"Sure, you can do that with Congress."
22443,-3,-1,They're all patriots but you've got to link arms and work with them.
22448,-3,-1,"Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education."
22450,-3,-1,And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don't have a chance go to this program when they're 3.
22451,-3,-1,Now we're going back to when the mother's pregnant and they'll start right after they're born.
22453,-3,1,Ninety percent are on the honor role.
22454,-3,-1,Now that will change America.
22455,-3,-1,Those children will all go to college.
22456,-3,-1,They will live the American dream.
22457,-3,-1,"And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn't have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they're unique and that they're precious and that there's only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom."
22458,-3,-1,And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific.
22459,-3,-1,"Now, finally, if you can't pay the bills you're dead in the water."
22460,-3,-1,And we have got to put our nation back to work.
22461,-3,-1,"Now, if you don't want to really do that I'm not your man."
22463,-3,-1,"In other words, unless we're going to do it, then pick somebody who likes to talk about it."
22464,-3,-1,"Now, just remember when you think about me -- I didn't create this mess."
22466,-3,-1,And for a guy that started out with everything he owned in the trunk of his car --
22470,-3,-1,But it's in your hands.
22472,-3,0,I'll see you tomorrow night -- (Laughter) on NBC -- 10:30 to 11:00 Eastern Time.
22475,-3,-1,"Thank you, Carole, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen."
22476,-3,-1,Since I suggested this format I hope it's been good for all of you.
22477,-3,-1,I really tried to be faithful to your request that we answer the questions specifically and pointedly.
22478,-3,-1,I thought I owed that to you and I respect you for being here and for the impact you've had on making this a more positive experience.
22479,-3,-1,These problems are not easy.
22480,-3,-1,They're not going to be solved overnight.
22486,-3,1,"This year my state ranks first in the country in job growth, 4th in manufacturing in job growth, 4th in income growth, 4th in the decline of poverty."
22489,-3,1,"That's why we've had 24 retired generals and admirals, hundreds of business people, many of them Republican, support this campaign."
22490,-3,-1,You have to decide whether you want to change or not.
22494,-3,1,I'm the only person here who's ever balanced a government budget and I've presented 12 of them and cut spending repeatedly.
22495,-3,-1,But you cannot just get there by balancing the budget.
22496,-3,-1,We've got to grow the economy by putting people first -- real people like you.
22497,-3,-1,I got into this race because I did not want my child to grow up to be part of the first generation of Americans to do worse than her parents.
22500,-3,-1,I want to make America as great as it can be and I ask for your help in doing it.
22559,-3,0,The chairman of the Republican Party thinks we ought to change a few things.
22563,-3,1,But the president has underfunded it by $28 billion.
22576,-3,1,The president wants to keep them open.
22586,-3,-1,"I can -- and thanks, Washington U. as well."
22588,-3,1,"He said he voted for the $87 billion, and voted against it right before he voted for it."
22596,-3,1,"You remember we increased that child credit by $1,000, reduced the marriage penalty, created a 10 percent tax bracket for the lower-income Americans."
22600,-3,-1,It's -- you've got to be consistent when you're the president.
22635,-3,-1,"I'm also going to talk -- respond to what you asked, Cheryl, at the same time."
22638,-3,-1,"Now, the president wishes that I had changed my mind."
22643,-3,-1,So what does he do?
22646,-3,-1,And he's trying to make you believe it because he wants you to think I change my mind.
22674,-3,1,"The goal of the sanctions was not to remove Saddam Hussein, it was to remove the weapons of mass destruction."
22707,-3,-1,"Now, that's not a good way to build support and reduce the risk for our troops and make America safer."
22710,-3,-1,And I'm going to get our allies back to the table.
22722,-3,1,"We'll have 125,000 trained by the end of December."
22762,-3,-1,"I -- listen, I -- we've got a great country."
22768,-3,1,"Yet at the same time, he was very -- we were very unpopular in Europe because of the decisions he made."
22772,-3,-1,"I wouldn't deal with Arafat, because I felt like he had let the former president down, and I don't think he's the kind of person that can lead toward a Palestinian state."
22774,-3,-1,"And that was unpopular, but it was the right thing to do."
22777,-3,-1,I don't think we ought to join that.
22810,-3,-1,"Do you have what it takes?"""
22858,-3,1,He was deceiving the inspectors.
22870,-3,1,He didn't honor the agreement.
22872,-3,-1,That is a bad policy.
22896,-3,-1,One of the more important things we're doing in this administration is transformation.
22935,-3,-1,"It denigrates an alliance to say we're going alone, to discount their sacrifices."
22942,-3,1,"If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States."
22947,-3,-1,My plan does a better job.
22974,-3,-1,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's his tax plan."
22991,-3,-1,"The Patriot Act is vital, by the way."
23021,-3,-1,"And the way to defeat them long-term, by the way, is to spread freedom."
23035,-3,-1,And that's why we're doing what we're doing.
23049,-3,-1,I think our seniors deserve a modern medical system.
23053,-3,0,"John, you heard the president just say that he thought he might try to be for it."
23060,-3,1,"He did block it, because we passed it in the United States Senate."
23072,-3,1,He put $139 billion of windfall profit into the pockets of the drug companies right out of your pockets.
23075,-3,1,"And I'm fighting to let you get those drugs from Canada, and I'm fighting to let Medicare survive."
23084,-3,1,"I've been in Washington, D.C., three and a half years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so our seniors have got a modern health care system."
23118,-3,1,He's done nothing about it.
23131,-3,-1,And that's saying something in that bunch.
23146,-3,1,It's the largest increase in federal government health care ever.
23161,-3,-1,"Yes, I think we should look at the punitive and we should have some limitations."
23180,-3,0,And he put a trial lawyer on the ticket.
23194,-3,-1,We've got to pay our troops more.
23232,-3,1,"One percent of America got more than the 80 percent of America that earned from $100,000 down."
23234,-3,-1,I want to put money in your pocket.
23277,-3,-1,"If you care about it, why don't you veto it?"
23319,-3,1,I voted for the balanced budget in '93 and '97.
23326,-3,0,It's been there for 20 years.
23327,-3,-1,"You can run, but you can't hide."
23341,-3,1,We've got an aggressive brown field program to refurbish inner-city sore spots to useful pieces of property.
23368,-3,1,I've been for faith-based initiatives helping to intervene in the lives of young children for years.
23372,-3,-1,"The Clear Skies bill that he just talked about, it's one of those Orwellian names you pull out of the sky, slap it onto something, like ""No Child Left Behind"" but you leave millions of children behind."
23376,-3,1,"In fact, his environmental enforcement chief air-quality person at the EPA resigned in protest over what they're doing to what they are calling the new source performance standards for air quality."
23387,-3,-1,"And we'll continue to spend money on research and development, because I truly believe that's the way to get from how we live today to being able to live a standard of living that we're accustomed to and being able to protect our environment better, the use of technologies."
23394,-3,-1,"You wonder, Nikki, why it is that people don't like us in some parts of the world."
23397,-3,1,The president's done nothing to try to fix it.
23405,-3,-1,Let me give you an example.
23406,-3,1,There is a tax loophole right now.
23414,-3,1,I have a plan to cover those folks.
23417,-3,-1,I think you ought to get the break.
23418,-3,-1,I want to lower your cost to health care.
23422,-3,-1,We've got to create the products of the future.
23439,-3,-1,"The best way to keep jobs here in America is, one, have an energy plan."
23446,-3,1,"Do you realize, 900,000 small businesses will be taxed under his plan because most small businesses are Subchapter S corps or limited partnerships, and they pay tax at the individual income tax level."
23447,-3,-1,"And so when you're running up the taxes like that, you're taxing job creators, and that's not how you keep jobs here."
23455,-3,-1,But let me just address what the president just said.
23457,-3,1,The Wall Street Journal said 96 percent of small businesses are not affected at all by my plan.
23459,-3,1,"The president got $84 from a timber company that owns, and he's counted as a small business."
23491,-3,-1,Our law enforcement must have every tool necessary to find and disrupt terrorists at home and abroad before they hurt us again.
23492,-3,-1,That's the task of the 21st century.
23494,-3,-1,And I know it's necessary.
23503,-3,1,"I met a man who spent eight months in prison, wasn't even allowed to call his lawyer, wasn't allowed to get -- finally, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois intervened and was able to get him out."
23511,-3,-1,I believe in the Patriot Act.
23522,-3,0,"But like Nancy Reagan, and so many other people -- you know, I was at a forum with Michael J."
23539,-3,-1,"I want the future, and I think we have to grab it."
23541,-3,1,Embryonic stem-cell research requires the destruction of life to create a stem cell.
23544,-3,-1,But I think we've got to be very careful in balancing the ethics and the science.
23548,-3,-1,"But as well, we need to continue to pursue adult stem-cell research."
23559,-3,1,Those stem- cells lines already existed.
23572,-3,-1,"I wouldn't pick a judge who said that the Pledge of Allegiance couldn't be said in a school because it had the words ""under God"" in it."
23578,-3,-1,It doesn't speak to the equality of America.
23592,-3,-1,"I don't believe we need a good conservative judge, and I don't believe we need a good liberal judge."
23600,-3,-1,Will we have equal opportunity?
23603,-3,-1,Will a woman's right to choose be protected?
23619,-3,-1,"But as a president, I have to represent all the people in the nation."
23627,-3,-1,"You'll actually do a better job, I think, of passing on the moral responsibility that is expressed in your question."
23645,-3,1,"And we need to promote maternity group homes, which my administration has done."
23661,-3,1,"And he was given a chance to vote, and he voted no."
23692,-3,-1,"On the tax cut, it's a big decision."
23694,-3,1,Our recession was one of the shallowest in modern history.
23699,-3,-1,"But history will look back, and I'm fully prepared to accept any mistakes that history judges to my administration, because the president makes the decisions, the president has to take the responsibility."
23702,-3,-1,"I ask each of you just to look into your hearts, look into your guts."
23706,-3,-1,And simple things weren't done.
23716,-3,-1,"And you can't say, because Saddam might have done it 10 years from now, that's a reason; that's an excuse."
23726,-3,-1,Which is a worse decision?
23744,-3,-1,Obviously the president and I both have very strong convictions.
23759,-3,1,I have a plan to protect the environment so that we leave this place in better shape to our children than we were handed it by our parents.
23769,-3,-1,Thank you all very much.
23773,-3,1,And yet think about where we are: Added 1.9 million new jobs over the past 13 months.
23820,-3,1,I think the principal that separates me is that 5 and a half million people came together on their own and put me on the ballot.
23823,-3,-1,"This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people."
23825,-3,-1,The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them.
23826,-3,-1,"I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them."
23827,-3,-1,So this comes from the people.
23829,-3,-1,"The most important distinction in this campaign is that I represent real hope for change, a departure from trickle-down economics, a departure from tax and spend economics, to invest in growth."
23830,-3,-1,"But before I can do that, I must challenge the American people to change, and they must decide."
23834,-3,-1,I want to bring that change to the American people.
23835,-3,-1,But we must all decide first we have the courage to change for hope and a better tomorrow.
23837,-3,-1,"Well, I think one thing that distinguishes is experience."
23838,-3,-1,I think we've dramatically changed the world.
23839,-3,-1,"I'll talk about that a little bit later, but the changes are mind-boggling for world peace."
23840,-3,-1,Kids go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war.
23841,-3,-1,And change for change sake isn't enough.
23843,-3,-1,But my economic program is the kind of change we want.
23844,-3,-1,And the way we're going to get it done is we're going to have a brand new Congress.
23846,-3,-1,"I'll sit down with them, Democrats and Republicans alike, and work for my agenda for American renewal, which represents real change."
23852,-3,-1,I've worked hard to create good jobs and to educate people.
23853,-3,1,"My state now ranks first in the country in job growth this year, fourth in income growth, fourth in reduction of poverty, third in overall economic performance, according to a major news magazine."
23854,-3,-1,That's because we believe in investing in education and in jobs.
23856,-3,0,"You know, my wife, Hillary, gave me a book about a year ago in which the author defined insanity as just doing the same old thing over and over again and expecting a different result."
23857,-3,-1,We have got to have the courage to change.
23861,-3,-1,I think the American people deserve better than they're getting.
23863,-3,1,Personal income has dropped while people have worked harder.
23867,-3,-1,"We're living in a new world after the Cold War, and what works in this new world is not trickle down, not government for the benefit of the privileged few, not tax and spend, but a commitment to invest in American jobs and American education, controlling American health care costs, and bringing the American people together."
23869,-3,-1,And you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience.
23870,-3,-1,"Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people, and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change."
23872,-3,-1,I just thought of another -- another big difference here between me.
23875,-3,-1,"Now, I know that the only way he can win is to make everybody believe the economy's worse than it is."
23876,-3,-1,"But this country is not coming apart at the seams, for heaven's sakes."
23877,-3,0,We're the United States of America.
23879,-3,-1,Many would trade for it.
23880,-3,-1,We've been caught up in a global slowdown.
23881,-3,-1,"We can do much, much better, but we ought not try to convince the American people that America is a country that's coming apart at the seams."
23882,-3,-1,I would hate to be running for president and think that the only way I could win would be to convince everybody how horrible things are.
23883,-3,-1,"Yes, there are big problems, and yes, people are hurting."
23884,-3,-1,"But I believe that this Agenda for American renewal I have is the answer to do it, and I believe we can get it done now, whereas we didn't in the past, because you're going to have a whole brand new bunch of people in the Congress that are going to have to listen to the same American people I'm listening to."
23890,-3,-1,"I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world."
23891,-3,-1,But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done.
23894,-3,-1,"So, if it's time for action, I think I have experience that counts."
23899,-3,-1,I think the American people should be the judge of that.
23900,-3,-1,I think character is a very important question.
23901,-3,-1,I said something the other day where I was accused of being like Joe McCarthy because I questioned -- I put it this way; I think it's wrong to demonstrate against your own country or organize demonstrations against your own country in foreign soil.
23902,-3,-1,I just think it's wrong.
23903,-3,-1,"I -- well, maybe they say, ""Well, it was a youthful indiscretion."""
23908,-3,-1,When I make a mistake I'll admit it.
23911,-3,-1,"Maybe I am, but I just don't think that's right."
23912,-3,-1,"Now, whether it's character or judgment -- whatever it is -- I have a big difference here on this issue and so we'll just have to see how it plays out."
23913,-3,-1,But I -- I couldn't do that.
23916,-3,-1,"Well, let's admit it then."
23920,-3,-1,So there are differences but that's about the main area where I think we have a difference.
23921,-3,-1,I don't know about -- we'll talk about that a little with Ross here in a bit.
23928,-3,-1,"Did they occur when you were a young person, in your formative years?"
23929,-3,-1,Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government?
23931,-3,-1,"If you make it as a young man, time passes."
23932,-3,-1,"So I would say just, you know, look at all three of us."
23933,-3,-1,Decide who you think will do the job.
23935,-3,-1,And we do have to have change and people who never take responsibility for anything when it happens on their watch and people who are in charge --
23942,-3,-1,Ross gave a good answer but I've got to respond directly to Mr. Bush.
23945,-3,1,"You even brought some right-wing congressman into the White House to plot how to attack me for going to Russia in 1969-70, when over 50,000 other Americans did."
23947,-3,-1,But when Joe McCarthy went around this country attacking people's patriotism he was wrong.
23953,-3,-1,I want to lead a unified country.
23961,-3,1,Those are the people who in the 1980s had their incomes go up while their taxes went down.
23962,-3,1,"Middle-class people, defined as people with incomes of $52,000 and down, had their incomes go down while their taxes went up in the Reagan-Bush years because of 6 increases in the payroll taxes."
23969,-3,-1,"Then we want to give modest middle-class tax relief to restore some fairness, especially to middle- class people with families with incomes of under $60,000."
23973,-3,-1,We don't need across-the-board tax cuts for the wealthy for nothing.
23974,-3,-1,"We need to say here's your tax incentive: if you create American jobs, the old-fashioned way."
23975,-3,1,"I'd like to create more millionaires than were created under Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan, but I don't want to have 4 years where we have no growth in the private sector, and that's what's happened in the last 4 years."
23977,-3,-1,"We need to invest and grow, and that's what I want to do."
23986,-3,-1,What I don't accept is demonstrating and organizing demonstrations in a foreign country when your country's at war.
23990,-3,-1,I do not believe we need to go back to the Mondale proposals or the Dukakis proposals of tax and spend.
23992,-3,1,"Taxing people over $200,000 will not get you $150 billion."
23994,-3,-1,That old adage they use--we're going to soak the rich- -we're going to soak the rich--it always ends up being the poor cab driver or the working man that ends up paying the bill.
23996,-3,-1,"I believe the way to get the deficit down is to control the growth of mandatory spending programs, and not raise taxes on the American people."
23997,-3,-1,We've got a big difference there.
24000,-3,-1,"We've got to have a growing, expanding job base to give us a growing, expanding tax base."
24006,-3,-1,We're going to go through a period of shared sacrifice.
24015,-3,1,"Well, Sander, that's a good question, and the answer is: for 40-some years we kept the peace."
24018,-3,1,I have cut defense spending.
24021,-3,-1,I think it is important that the US stay in Europe and continue to guarantee the peace.
24023,-3,-1,"Now, when anybody has a spending program they want to spend money on at home, they say, well, let's cut money out of the Defense Dept."
24026,-3,-1,And so I simply do not think we should go back to the isolation days and starting blaming foreigners.
24029,-3,-1,"But I would ask the American people to understand that if we make imprudent cuts, if we go too far, we risk the peace."
24030,-3,-1,And I don't want to do that.
24032,-3,1,Because of our programs we have been able to significantly cut defense spending.
24036,-3,-1,"I think it goes with world leadership, and I think the levels we've come up with are just about right."
24038,-3,-1,"If I'm poor and you're rich, and I can get you to defend me, that's good."
24039,-3,-1,"But when the tables get turned, I ought to do my share."
24040,-3,1,"Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense, the Japanese spend around 30 billion in Asia, the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe."
24041,-3,1,"For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years."
24043,-3,1,The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past.
24044,-3,-1,"I agree with the president: when they couldn't, we should have; now that they can, they should."
24046,-3,-1,"They don't want us to control it, very candidly."
24052,-3,-1,We certainly must maintain an engagement there.
24054,-3,1,"But 2 former defense secretaries recently issued a report saying that 100,000 or slightly fewer troops would be enough, including President Reagan's former defense secretary, Mr. Carlucci."
24056,-3,-1,"We're going to have to spend more money in the future on military technology and on greater mobility, greater airlift, greater sealift, the B-22 airplane."
24057,-3,-1,We're going to have to do some things that are quite costly.
24058,-3,1,"And I simply don't believe we can afford nor do we need to keep 150,000 troops in Europe given how much the Red Army, now under the control of Russia, has been cut, the arms control agreement concluded between Mr. Bush and Mr. Yeltsin, something I have applauded."
24059,-3,-1,"I don't think we need 150,000 troops."
24061,-3,0,Mr. Bush talked about taxes.
24062,-3,1,He didn't tell you that he vetoed a middle class tax cut because it would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy and vetoed an investment tax credit paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy.
24068,-3,1,It's 10 cents a year cumulative.
24070,-3,-1,"I think ""punish"" is the wrong word."
24072,-3,-1,We're trying to solve it.
24073,-3,1,"Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3.50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs."
24074,-3,1,"We collect 35 cents, and we don't have it to spend."
24079,-3,-1,"And if we don't, we will be spending our children's money."
24080,-3,1,We have spent $4 trillion worth.
24082,-3,-1,I think it's fitting that we're on the campus of a university tonight.
24083,-3,-1,"These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job."
24084,-3,-1,"We've got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them."
24085,-3,-1,We've got to collect the taxes to do it.
24086,-3,-1,"If there's a fairer way, I'm all ears (laughter) --aah."
24088,-3,-1,"If people don't have the stomach to fix these problems, I think it's a good time to face it, November."
24094,-3,1,"People are working harder for less money than they were making 10 years ago, 2- 3rds of our people--a $1600 drop in average income in just the last 2 years."
24095,-3,1,"The problem I have with the Perot prescription is that almost all economists who've looked at it say that if you cut the deficit this much this quick it will increase unemployment, it will slow down the economy."
24096,-3,-1,That's why I think we shouldn't do it that quickly.
24097,-3,-1,"We have a disciplined reduction in the deficit of 50 % over the next 4 years, but first get incentives to invest in this economy, put the American people back to work."
24098,-3,-1,We've got to invest and grow.
24099,-3,1,"9 Nobel Prize-winning economists and 500 others, including numerous Republican and Democratic business executives, have endorsed this approach because it offers the best hope to put America back to work and get our incomes rising instead of falling."
24101,-3,-1,Your question was on fairness.
24102,-3,-1,I just disagree with Mr. Perot.
24103,-3,-1,"I don't believe it is fair to slap a 50-cent-a-gallon tax over whatever many years on the people that have to drive for a living, people that go long distances."
24104,-3,-1,I don't think we need to do it.
24106,-3,-1,"I agree with what he's talking about in trying to get this spending down and the discipline, although I think we ought to totally exempt Social Security."
24107,-3,-1,"But he's talking tough medicine, and I think that's good."
24108,-3,-1,I disagree with the tax-and-spend philosophy.
24112,-3,-1,He's mentioned some ways to do it--and I agree with those.
24115,-3,-1,I'm for an investment tax allowance; I'm for a tax break for first- time homebuyers.
24116,-3,-1,"And with this new Congress coming in, gridlock will be gone, and I'll sit down with them and say let's get this done."
24124,-3,-1,"I assume she was supportive of the decision on McDonnell Douglas, I assume she was supporting me on the decision to sell those airplanes."
24125,-3,-1,"I think it's a good decision--took a little heat for it, but I think it was the correct decision to do."
24126,-3,-1,"And we worked it out, and indeed we're moving forward all around the world in a much more peaceful way."
24127,-3,1,So that one we came away with in creating jobs for the American people.
24128,-3,-1,"I would simply say to her, look, take a look at what the president has proposed on job retraining."
24132,-3,-1,Therein is the best answer to her.
24133,-3,-1,And another one is: stimulate investment and savings.
24136,-3,-1,I am a firm believer that our America 2000 education problem is the answer--a little longer run; it's going to take awhile to educate.
24139,-3,-1,"But tell her it's not all that gloomy; we're the US, we faced tough problems before."
24140,-3,-1,Look at the misery index when the Democrats had both the White House and the Congress.
24142,-3,-1,"Now, we can do better."
24143,-3,-1,"And the way to do better is not to tax and spend but to retrain, get that control of the mandatory spending programs."
24144,-3,-1,I'm much more optimistic about this country than some.
24150,-3,-1,"And the sooner they start, the sooner they'll finish."
24151,-3,-1,And there will be a significant transition.
24155,-3,1,"Number one, you make more making computer chips than potato chips; and, number 2, 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan."
24156,-3,1,We've given away whole industries.
24159,-3,-1,We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over.
24160,-3,-1,"Now, see, we practice 19th century capitalism."
24161,-3,-1,The rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism.
24163,-3,-1,"In the rest of the world, the countries and the businesses would be working together to make this transition in an intelligent way."
24165,-3,-1,We must have a transition plan to plan to convert from a defense to a domestic economy.
24167,-3,1,"There are 200,000 people unemployed in California alone because we have cut defense without planning to retrain them and to reinvest in the technologies of the future here at home."
24168,-3,-1,That is what I want to do.
24169,-3,1,"This administration may say they have a plan, but the truth is they have not even released all the money, the paltry sum of money, that Congress appropriated."
24170,-3,-1,"I want to take very dollar by which we reduce defense and reinvest it in technologies for the 21st century--in new transportation, in communication, in environmental clean-up technologies."
24171,-3,-1,"Let's put the American people to work, and let's build the kind of high-tech, high-wage, high-growth economy that the American people deserve."
24183,-3,-1,It's like having a blueprint for a house you never built.
24185,-3,-1,"Now our challenge is to take these things, do something with them."
24186,-3,-1,"Step one, we want to put America back to work, clean up the small business problem, have one task force at work on that."
24188,-3,-1,Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don't wind up in Europe and Asia.
24189,-3,-1,Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism.
24192,-3,-1,"Then have another task force on crime because, next to jobs, our people are concerned about their safety."
24193,-3,-1,"Health care, schools--one on the debt and deficit."
24194,-3,-1,"And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present."
24201,-3,-1,"Small business--you've got to have capital, you've got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches."
24202,-3,-1,And we can create more jobs there in a hurry than any other place.
24204,-3,-1,"This country desperately needs a jobs program, and my first priority would be to pass a jobs program, to introduce it on the first day I was inaugurated."
24205,-3,-1,"I would meet with the leaders of the Congress, with all the newly elected members of the Congress and as many others with whom I could meet between the time of the election and the inauguration, and we would present a jobs program."
24206,-3,-1,Then we would present a plan to control health care costs and phase in health care coverage for all Americans.
24208,-3,-1,It is the number one culprit.
24210,-3,1,"I live in a state where manufacturing job growth has far outpaced the nation in the last few years, where we have created more private sector jobs since Mr. Bush has been president than have been created in the entire rest of the country, where Mr. Bush's labor secretary said job growth has been enormous."
24212,-3,-1,Give me a chance to create these kind of jobs in America.
24218,-3,-1,"I've already put forward things that'll get this country working fast, some of which have been echoed here tonight--investment tax allowance, capital gains reduction, more on research and development, tax credit for first-time home buyers."
24219,-3,-1,"What I'm going to do is say to Jim Baker when this campaign is over, all right, let's sit down now, you do in domestic affairs what you've done in foreign affairs, be kind of the economic coordinator of all the domestic side of the House, and that includes all the economic side, all the training side, and bring this program together."
24220,-3,-1,"We're going to have a new Congress, and we're going to say to them, you've listened to the voters the way we have."
24221,-3,-1,"Nobody wants gridlock anymore, and so let's get the program through."
24222,-3,-1,"And I believe it'll work because, as Ross said, we got the plans."
24223,-3,-1,The plans are all over Washington.
24232,-3,-1,"But frankly, I don't think that's the problem today."
24237,-3,-1,"But I think the important thing--the important thing-- is to use the powers the president does have on the assumption that, given the condition of this economy, we're going to keep interest rates down if we have the discipline to increase investment and reduce the debt at the same time."
24239,-3,-1,I think the American people are ready for action.
24241,-3,1,"Someone who will not veto a bill that has an investment tax credit, middle class tax relief, research and development tax credits as Mr. Bush has done."
24244,-3,-1,"Their policies so far, it seems to me, are pretty sound."
24247,-3,-1,There is a separation there.
24250,-3,-1,"I've had some arguments with him about the speed in which we might have lowered interest rates, but Governor Clinton, he talks about the reaction to the markets."
24253,-3,-1,It's been very strong since I've been president.
24257,-3,-1,"And I'm going to keep on vetoing them, because I don't think we're taxed too little."
24258,-3,-1,I think the government's spending too much.
24259,-3,-1,So Governor Clinton can label it tax for the rich or anything he wants.
24260,-3,-1,"I'm going to protect the working man by continuing to veto, and to threaten to veto until we get this new Congress, and then we're going to move forward on our plan."
24263,-3,-1,"Keep the Federal Reserve independent, but let's live in a world of reality."
24265,-3,-1,These interest rates we have now don't make any sense.
24270,-3,-1,"That gap is going to close, because the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries because they can get more money."
24272,-3,-1,Whichever place you put it.
24274,-3,-1,"Just think in your own business, if you had all of your long term problems financed short term."
24280,-3,-1,"Again, if you're not rich, you're not a superpower."
24281,-3,-1,So we have two that I'd put as number one.
24283,-3,-1,"One is we've got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and we've got to manufacture here."
24284,-3,-1,"Believe it or not folks, you can't ship it all overseas, you've got to make it here."
24287,-3,-1,We've got to make things here.
24289,-3,-1,I hope we can talk more about that.
24291,-3,-1,We've got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics.
24292,-3,-1,"When we think of Russia, remember we're thinking of many countries, now."
24293,-3,-1,We've got to help them.
24297,-3,-1,It's a very unstable situation.
24298,-3,1,You've got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons.
24300,-3,-1,And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road.
24302,-3,-1,And we've focused on the tactical.
24308,-3,-1,"And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil."
24309,-3,-1,Because they could go back worse than things used to be.
24310,-3,-1,And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K.G.B.
24311,-3,-1,and the military that liked it better the way it used to be.
24313,-3,-1,"In order to keep America the strongest nation in the world, we need some continuity and some change."
24315,-3,-1,"First of all, the world is still a dangerous and uncertain place."
24317,-3,-1,"We need to continue the negotiations to reduce the nuclear arsenals in the Soviet Union, the former Soviet Union, and the United States."
24320,-3,1,Our dollar's at an all time low against some foreign currencies.
24321,-3,-1,We're weak in the world.
24322,-3,-1,We must rebuild America's strength at home.
24323,-3,-1,"And finally, we ought to be promoting the democratic impulses around the world."
24325,-3,-1,They don't go to war with each other.
24326,-3,-1,They're reliable friends in the future.
24327,-3,-1,"National security, economic strength, democracy."
24329,-3,-1,"Well, we still are the envy of the world in terms of our military."
24330,-3,-1,There's no question about that.
24331,-3,-1,"We're the envy of the world in terms of our economy, despite the difficulties we're having."
24332,-3,-1,There's no question about that.
24334,-3,1,"I might say to Mr. Perot, I can understand why you might have missed it, because there's so much fascination with trivia, but I worked out a deal with Boris Yeltsin to eliminate, get rid of entirely, the most destabilizing weapons of all, the SS-18, the intercontinental ballistic missile."
24335,-3,1,"I mean, that's been done."
24336,-3,-1,"And thank God, it has, because the parents of these young people around here go to bed at night without the same fear of nuclear war."
24340,-3,-1,And we're more respected because of the way we have conducted ourselves.
24341,-3,-1,We didn't listen to the nuclear freeze crowd.
24344,-3,-1,"But we're so, turned so inward we don't understand the global picture."
24345,-3,-1,"And we are helping democracy, Ross."
24347,-3,-1,And we're going to keep on doing that.
24351,-3,-1,"I think our relationships with China are important and I don't want to isolate China, but I think it is a mistake for us to do what this Administration did when all those kids went out there carrying the Statue of Liberty in Tiananmen Square."
24354,-3,-1,That was their response to that sort of action.
24355,-3,-1,"Now that the voices in the Congress and throughout the country have insisted that we do something about China, look at what has happened."
24356,-3,1,China has finally agreed to stop sending us products made with prison labor.
24359,-3,1,The second biggest surplus next to Japan.
24360,-3,-1,So I would be firm.
24361,-3,-1,"I would say if you want to continue as Most Favored Nation status for your government owned industries as well as your private ones, observe human rights in the future."
24363,-3,-1,Recognize the legitimacy of those kids that were carrying the Statue of Liberty.
24367,-3,1,"Well, the Administration was the first major country to stand up to the abuse in Tiananmen Square."
24368,-3,1,We are the one that worked out the prison labor deal.
24369,-3,1,We are the ones that lowered the barrier to products with Carla Hill's negotiation.
24374,-3,1,We were the first ones to put sanctions on.
24378,-3,-1,and kind of humiliating them is not the way you make the kind of progress we are getting.
24380,-3,-1,"But you isolate China and turn them inward, and then we've made a tremendous mistake."
24381,-3,-1,And I'm not going to do it.
24385,-3,-1,He went over to say we must make the very changes they're making now.
24388,-3,0,"China, is a huge country, broken into many provinces."
24389,-3,-1,It has some very elderly leaders that will not be around too much longer.
24391,-3,-1,Asia will be our largest trading partner in the future.
24393,-3,-1,"We have a delicate, tight-wire walk that we must go through at the present time to make sure that we do not cozy up to tyrants, to make sure that they don't get the impression that they can suppress their people."
24394,-3,-1,"But time is our friend there, because their leaders will change in not too many years, worst case, and their country is making great progress."
24395,-3,-1,One last point on the missiles.
24396,-3,-1,I don't want the American people to be confused.
24399,-3,-1,"Till they're destroyed, some crazy person can either sell them or use them."
24407,-3,1,American airplanes are helping today on humanitarian relief for Sarajevo.
24409,-3,-1,"But when you go to put somebody else's son or daughter into war, I think you got to be a little bit careful and you have to be sure that there's a military plan that can do this."
24410,-3,-1,"You have ancient ethnic rivalries that have cropped up as Yugoslavia's dissolved or getting dissolved, and it isn't going to be solved by sending in the 82nd Airborne, and I'm not going to do that as commander-in-chief."
24411,-3,1,"I am going to stand by and use the moral persuasion of the US to get satisfaction in terms of prison camps, and we're making some progress there, and in terms of getting humanitarian relief in there."
24413,-3,-1,We're working through the international organizations.
24416,-3,-1,I am very concerned about it.
24417,-3,-1,I am concerned about ethnic cleansing.
24420,-3,-1,And I think I'm on the right track.
24425,-3,-1,I think if we learned anything in Vietnam is you first commit this nation before you commit the troops to the battlefield.
24427,-3,-1,This is basically a problem that is a primary concern to the European Community.
24433,-3,-1,"It's very important that we not just, without thinking it through, just rush to every problem in the world and have our people torn to pieces."
24436,-3,-1,"But I think that it's important to recognize that there are things that can be done short of that, and that we do have interests there."
24437,-3,1,"There are, after all, 2 million refugees now because of the problems in what was Yugoslavia, the largest number since World War II, and there may be hundreds of thousands of people who will starve or freeze to death in this winter."
24438,-3,-1,The US should try to work with its allies and stop it.
24439,-3,1,"I urged the president to support this air cover, and he did--and I applaud that."
24442,-3,-1,"We can't get involved in the quagmire, but we must do what we can."
24446,-3,-1,"A good family is a place where love and discipline and good values are transmuted (sic) from the elders to the children, a place where people turn for refuge, and where they know they're the most important people in the world."
24447,-3,-1,America has a lot of families that are in trouble today.
24452,-3,1,I've seen the family values of all these people in America who are out there killing themselves working harder for less in a country that's had the worst economic years in 50 years and the first decline in industrial production ever.
24455,-3,1,Seventy-two other nations have been able to do it.
24456,-3,1,"Mr. Bush vetoed it twice because he says we can't do something seventy-two other countries do, even though there was a small business exemption."
24457,-3,-1,"So with all the talk about family values, I know about family values -- I wouldn't be here without them."
24458,-3,0,"The best expression of my family values is that tonight's my 17th wedding anniversary, and I'd like to close my question by just wishing my wife a happy anniversary, and thank you, my daughter, for being here."
24461,-3,0,"Well, I would say that one meeting that made a profound impression on me was when the mayors of the big cities, including the mayor of Los Angeles, a Democrat, came to see me, and they unanimously said the decline in urban America stems from the decline in the American family."
24462,-3,-1,So I do think we need to strengthen family.
24465,-3,-1,"I'm appalled at the highest outrageous numbers of divorces -- it happens in families, it's happened in ours."
24470,-3,-1,And one way to do it is to get these deadbeat fathers to pay their obligations to these mothers -- that will help strengthen the American family.
24475,-3,-1,They develop a positive or negative self- image.
24477,-3,-1,"If we have children who are not surrounded with love and affection -- you see, I look at my grandchildren and wonder if they'll ever learn to walk because they're always in someone's arms."
24480,-3,-1,We will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home.
24491,-3,-1,"No, I don't think that's the right answer."
24492,-3,-1,I don't believe legalizing narcotics is the answer.
24493,-3,-1,I just don't believe that's the answer.
24494,-3,-1,I do believe that there's some fairly good news out there.
24497,-3,-1,We're doing a little better in interdiction.
24498,-3,1,"Many of the countries below that used to say, well, this is the US' problem -- if you'd get the demand down, then we wouldn't have the problem -- are working cooperatively with the DEA and the military."
24499,-3,1,We're using the military more now in terms of interdiction.
24500,-3,1,"Our funding for recovery is up, recovering the addicts."
24501,-3,-1,"Where we're not making the progress, Sander, is in -- we're making it in teenagers, and thank God, because I thought what Ross said was most appropriate about these families and these children."
24502,-3,-1,But where we're not making it is with the confirmed addicts.
24506,-3,-1,"And people are beginning to educate through this program, teaching these kids you shouldn't use drugs."
24507,-3,-1,So we're still in the fight.
24509,-3,-1,"And I oppose it, and I'm going to stand up and continue to oppose it."
24514,-3,1,"And the reason is crack babies being born, babies in the hospital 42 days."
24516,-3,-1,"Again and again and again, the mother disappears in 3 days, and the child becomes a ward of the state because he's permanently and genetically damaged."
24519,-3,0,"You know, we went on the Libyan raid -- do you remember that one?"
24520,-3,-1,-- because we were worried to death that Gaddafi might be building up chemical weapons.
24521,-3,-1,"We've got chemical warfare being conducted against our children on the streets in this country all day every day, and we don't have the will to stamp it out."
24522,-3,-1,"Now, again, if I get up there, if you send me, we're going to have some blunt talks about this, and we're really going to get down in the trenches and say, is this one you want to talk about or fix, because talk won't do it, folks."
24530,-3,-1,But I can tell you this.
24532,-3,-1,I am adamantly opposed to legalizing drugs.
24533,-3,-1,He is alive today because of the criminal justice system.
24540,-3,-1,I have a plan for that.
24541,-3,-1,"Secondly, we ought to have treatment on demand."
24542,-3,-1,"Thirdly, we ought to have boot camps for first-time nonviolent offenders so they can get discipline and treatment and education and get reconnected to the community before they're severed and sent to prison, where they can learn how to be first class criminals."
24543,-3,1,"There is a crime bill that, lamentably, was blocked from passage once again, mostly by Republicans in the US Senate, which would have addressed some of these problems."
24550,-3,-1,This is a relevant question here tonight.
24555,-3,-1,"And if we can't love one another, we ought to get along with one another."
24558,-3,-1,"Now, that ought to get everybody back up to let's get along together and make it work."
24560,-3,-1,We've turned it into a weakness.
24561,-3,-1,"Now again, the White House is a bully pulpit."
24563,-3,-1,"See, our differences are our strengths."
24565,-3,-1,"In athletics, we know it."
24566,-3,-1,"See, divided teams lose; united teams win."
24567,-3,-1,"We have got to unite and pull together, and there's nothing we can't do."
24569,-3,-1,We're becoming more and more of a melting pot.
24570,-3,-1,"Let's make it a strength, not a weakness."
24574,-3,-1,"I saw the winds of hatred divide people and keep the people of my state poorer than they would have been, spiritually and economically."
24575,-3,-1,And I've done everything I could in my public life to overcome racial divisions.
24578,-3,-1,And I have devoted a major portion of this campaign to going across this country and looking for opportunities to go to white groups and African American groups and Latino groups and Asian American groups and say the same thing.
24579,-3,-1,"If the American people cannot be brought together, we can't turn this country around."
24583,-3,-1,"Well, I think Governor Clinton is committed."
24586,-3,1,We passed two very forward-looking civil rights bills.
24587,-3,-1,It's not going to be all done by legislation.
24588,-3,-1,"But I do think that you need to make an appeal every time you can to eliminate racial divisions and discrimination, and I'll keep on doing that and pointing to some legislative accomplishment to back it up."
24591,-3,-1,I have watched these people -- the same for our local law enforcement people.
24593,-3,1,"But maybe you meant that some in the country don't have the will to fight it, but those that are out there on the front line, as you know -- you've been a strong backer of law enforcement -- really -- I just want to clear that up --have the will to fight it, and, frankly, some of them are giving their lives."
24601,-3,-1,Coming from the political process.
24602,-3,1,We have increased funding for AIDS.
24604,-3,1,My request for this year was $4.9 billion for AIDS -- ten times as much per AIDS victim as per cancer victim.
24605,-3,-1,I think that we're showing the proper compassion and concern.
24607,-3,1,"We're funding them. I wish there was more money -- but we're funding them far more than any time in the past, and we're going to keep on doing that."
24613,-3,-1,It was a beautiful moment and I think she'll do a first-class job on that commission.
24614,-3,-1,"So I think the appeal is yes, we care."
24620,-3,-1,You can't talk about it rationally.
24621,-3,-1,The extremes are hurting the AIDS cause.
24622,-3,-1,"To go into a Catholic mass in a beautiful cathedral in New York under the cause of helping in AIDS and start throwing condoms around in the mass, I'm sorry, I think it sets back the cause."
24625,-3,-1,We've got to continue everything we can at the federal and the local level.
24626,-3,-1,Barbara I think is doing a superb job in destroying the myth about AIDS.
24627,-3,-1,"And all of us are in this fight together, all of us care."
24628,-3,-1,Do not go to the extreme.
24631,-3,-1,"First, I think Mary Fisher was a great choice."
24633,-3,-1,"Secondly, I think one thing that if I were sent to do the job, I would sit down with FDA, look at exactly where we are."
24634,-3,-1,Then I would really focus on let's get these things out.
24637,-3,-1,And we could be moving out to the human population a whole lot faster than we are on some of these new drugs.
24638,-3,-1,So I would think we can expedite the problem there.
24640,-3,-1,"The all- time low in our country was the Judge Thomas-Anita Hill hearings, and those senators ought to be hanging their heads in shame for what they did there."
24642,-3,-1,"2nd thing, there are not many times in your life when you get to talk to a whole country."
24643,-3,-1,"But let me just say to all of America: if you hate people, I don't want your vote."
24647,-3,1,"Over 150,000 Americans have died of AIDS."
24649,-3,-1,We need to put one person in charge of the battle against AIDS to cut across all the agencies that deal with it.
24650,-3,-1,We need to accelerate the drug approval process.
24651,-3,-1,We need to fully fund the act named for that wonderful boy Ryan White to make sure we're doing everything we can on research and treatment.
24652,-3,-1,"And the president should lead a national effort to change behavior, to keep our children alive in the schools, responsible behavior to keep people alive."
24653,-3,-1,This is a matter of life and death.
24664,-3,-1,"Number one, if I get there, it will be a very unusual and historical event --"
24667,-3,-1,I will have a unique mandate.
24670,-3,-1,"Now, all these fellows with thousand-dollar suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of Congress that make policy now -- the lobbyists, the PAC guys, the foreign lobbyists, and what-have-you, they'll be over there in the Smithsonian, you know --"
24672,-3,-1,"-- because we're going to get rid of them, and the Congress will be listening to the people."
24674,-3,-1,They're not as stupid as Washington thinks they are.
24675,-3,-1,"The American people are bright, intelligent, caring, loving people who want a great country for their children and grandchildren."
24679,-3,-1,"-- because if the American people send me there, we'll get it done."
24681,-3,-1,They've never seen anything happen in that town.
24684,-3,-1,"And I'm sitting there and saying, well, who else could be around, you know?"
24685,-3,-1,"Then when they get off by themselves, they say nobody did it."
24687,-3,-1,"And yet the cash register's empty and it used to have our money, the taxpayers' money, in it, and we didn't get the results."
24688,-3,-1,"No, we'll get it done."
24691,-3,-1,"Ross, that's a great speech, but it's not quite that simple."
24696,-3,1,The president's got another proposal to require them to pay $400 a year more for the next 5 years.
24698,-3,-1,Costs will continue to spiral.
24699,-3,-1,"And just remember this, folks."
24700,-3,1,"A lot of folks on Medicare are out there every day making the choice between food and medicine; not poor enough for Medicare-Medicaid, not wealthy enough to buy their medicine."
24701,-3,0,"I've met them, people like Mary Annie and Edward Davis in Nashua, New Hampshire."
24709,-3,1,"I'm the president that stood up and said, don't mess with Social Security, and I'm not going to and we haven't and we are not going to go after the Social Security recipient."
24710,-3,-1,I have one difference with Mr. Perot on that because I don't think we need to touch Social Security.
24714,-3,-1,"So what we've got to do is control it, let it grow for inflation, let it grow for the amount of new people added, population, and then hold the line."
24715,-3,-1,"And I believe that is the way you get the deficit down, not by the tax-and-spend program that we hear every 4 years, whether it's Mondale, Dukakis, whoever else it is."
24716,-3,-1,I just don't believe we ought to do that.
24717,-3,-1,So hold the line on Social Security and put a cap on the growth of the mandatory program.
24729,-3,-1,I thought the Oregon plan should at least have been allowed to be tried because at least the people in Oregon were trying to do something.
24731,-3,-1,Mr. Bush is trying to run against Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter and everybody in the world but me in this race.
24733,-3,-1,I will say again: you cannot control health care costs simply by cutting Medicare.
24735,-3,1,"The federal government has cut Medicare and Medicaid in the last few years, states have cut Medicaid -- we've done it in Arkansas under budget pressures."
24737,-3,1,More and more people get on the rolls as poverty increases.
24740,-3,1,"We set up a national ceiling on health care costs tied to inflation and population growth set by health care providers, not by the government."
24741,-3,-1,"We provide for managed competition, not government models, in every states."
24744,-3,-1,I've got a plan to control health care costs.
24746,-3,-1,"And you have to have cost controls, yes."
24750,-3,-1,I'm tired of being told we can't.
24755,-3,-1,"Well, I don't have time in 30 seconds, or whatever -- a minute -- to talk about our health care reform plan."
24756,-3,-1,"The Oregon plan made some good sense, but it's easy to dismiss the concerns of the disabled."
24757,-3,1,"As president I have to be sure that those waivers, which we're approving all over the place, are covered under the law."
24758,-3,-1,Maybe we can work it out.
24763,-3,-1,"If you want to help somebody, don't run the costs up by making doctors have to have 5 or 6 tests where one would do for fear of being sued, or have somebody along the highway not stop to pick up a guy and help him because he's afraid a trial lawyer will come along and sue him."
24764,-3,-1,We're suing each other too much and caring for each other too little.
24768,-3,-1,So we don't have the best.
24769,-3,-1,"Pretty simple, folks -- if you're paying more and you don't have the best, if all else fails go copy the people who have the best who spend less, right?"
24771,-3,-1,"Again, we've got plans lying all over the place in Washington."
24773,-3,-1,Now I'm back to square one.
24774,-3,-1,"If you want to stop talking about it and do it, then I'll be glad to go up there and we'll get it done."
24775,-3,-1,"But if you just want to keep the music going, just stay traditional this next time around, and 4 years from now you'll have everybody blaming everybody else for a bad health care system."
24776,-3,-1,"Talk is cheap; words are plentiful, deeds are precious."
24784,-3,-1,"Well, it's been a privilege to be able to talk to the American people tonight."
24785,-3,-1,I make no bones about it.
24787,-3,-1,I love the principle it's founded on.
24789,-3,-1,I don't like to see the country's principles violated.
24791,-3,-1,The people in Washington are good people.
24792,-3,-1,We just have a bad system.
24793,-3,-1,We've got to change the system.
24795,-3,-1,We've got to put our house in order.
24799,-3,-1,Isn't it time to stop creating images?
24801,-3,-1,Aren't you sick of being treated like an unprogrammed robot?
24802,-3,-1,"Every 4 years, they send you all kinds of messages to tell you how to vote and then go back to business as usual."
24804,-3,1,They didn't tell you that that same year they increased spending $1.83 for every dollar we increased taxes.
24805,-3,-1,That's Washington in a nutshell right there.
24806,-3,-1,"In the final analysis, I'm doing this for your children when you look at them tonight."
24807,-3,-1,"There's another group that I feel very close to, and these at the men and women who fought on the battlefield, the children -- the families -- of the ones who died and the people who left parts of their bodies over there."
24808,-3,-1,"I'd never ask you to do anything for me, but I owe you this, and I'm doing it for you."
24810,-3,-1,And then I think of the older people who are retired.
24812,-3,0,They fought and won World War II.
24813,-3,-1,We owe you a debt we can never repay you.
24814,-3,-1,And the greatest repayment I can ever give is to recreate the American dream for your children and grandchildren.
24815,-3,-1,"I'll give you everything I have, if you want me to do it."
24820,-3,-1,"Most of all, I'd like to thank all of you who have touched me in some way over this last year, all the thousands of you whom I've seen."
24824,-3,0,"I'd like to thank all the folks around America that no one ever knows about -- the woman that was holding the AIDS baby she adopted in Cedar Rapids, Iowa who asked me to do something more for adoption; the woman who stopped along the road in Wisconsin and wept because her husband had lost his job after 27 years; all the people who are having a tough time and the people who are winning but who know how desperately we need to change."
24825,-3,-1,"This debate tonight has made crystal clear a challenge that is as old as America -- the choice between hope and fear, change or more of the same, the courage to move into a new tomorrow or to listen to the crowd who says things could be worse."
24826,-3,-1,Mr. Bush has said some very compelling things tonight that don't quite square with the record.
24828,-3,-1,I offer a new direction.
24830,-3,-1,"I want the future of this country to be as bright and brilliant as its past, and it can be if we have the courage to change."
24835,-3,-1,You have to make tough calls.
24836,-3,-1,You can't be on one hand this way and one hand another.
24837,-3,-1,You can't take different positions on these difficult issues.
24838,-3,-1,And then you need a philosophical -- I'd call it a philosophical underpinning.
24839,-3,-1,"Mine for foreign affairs is democracy and freedom, and look at the dramatic changes around the world."
24842,-3,1,"Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, the Baltics are free."
24846,-3,1,And we kicked this man out of Kuwait.
24847,-3,1,"And in the process, as a result of that will and that decision and that toughness, we now have ancient enemies talking peace in the Middle East."
24849,-3,-1,And I think the biggest dividend of making these tough calls is the fact that we are less afraid of nuclear war.
24850,-3,-1,Every parent out there has much less worry that their kids are going to be faced with nuclear holocaust.
24855,-3,-1,We need to invest and save.
24856,-3,-1,We need to do better in education.
24857,-3,-1,We need to do better in job retraining.
24859,-3,-1,And we need to strengthen the American family.
24860,-3,-1,I hope as president that I've earned your trust.
24861,-3,-1,"I've admitted it when I make a mistake, but then I go on and help, try to solve the problems."
24862,-3,-1,I hope I've earned your trust because a lot of being president is about trust and character.
24864,-3,-1,"Thank you very, very much."
24900,-3,-1,I believe that the question oversimplifies the difficulties of what we must do in Central America.
24901,-3,-1,"Our objectives ought to be to strengthen the democracies, to stop Communist and other extremist influences, and stabilize the community in that area."
24902,-3,-1,"To do that we need a three-pronged attack: one is military assistance to our friends who are being pressured; secondly, a strong and sophisticated economic aid program and human rights program that offers a better life and a sharper alternative to the alternative offered by the totalitarians who oppose us; and finally, a strong diplomatic effort that pursues the possibilities of peace in the area."
24904,-3,-1,This brings up the whole question of what Presidential leadership is all about.
24905,-3,1,"I think the lesson in Central America, this recent embarrassment in Nicaragua where we are giving instructions for hired assassins, hiring criminals, and the rest -- all of this has strengthened our opponents."
24906,-3,-1,"A President must not only assure that we're tough, but we must also be wise and smart in the exercise of that power."
24908,-3,-1,"But because the leadership of this government did not pursue wise policies, we have been humiliated, and our opponents are stronger."
24909,-3,-1,"The bottom line of national strength is that the President must be in command, he must lead."
24910,-3,1,"And when a President doesn't know that submarine missiles are recallable, says that 70 percent of our strategic forces are conventional, discovers 3 years into his administration that our arms control efforts have failed because he didn't know that most Soviet missiles were on land -- these are things a President must know to command."
24911,-3,0,A President is called the Commander in Chief.
24912,-3,-1,And he's called that because he's supposed to be in charge of the facts and run our government and strengthen our nation.
24919,-3,-1,You must understand the region; you must understand the politics in the area; you must provide a strong alternative; and you must show strength -- and all at the same time.
24920,-3,-1,That's why I object to the covert action in Nicaragua.
24921,-3,-1,"That's a classic example of a strategy that's embarrassed us, strengthened our opposition, and undermined the moral authority of our people and our country in the region."
24927,-3,-1,"No, but I'm glad you asked that question, because I know it's on many peoples' minds."
24928,-3,1,I have ordered an investigation.
24929,-3,1,I know that the CIA is already going forward with one.
24930,-3,1,"We have a gentleman down in Nicaragua who is on contract to the CIA, advising -- supposedly on military tactics -- the contras."
24931,-3,0,And he drew up this manual.
24934,-3,1,"But some way or other, there were 12 of the original copies that got out down there and were not submitted for this printing process by the CIA."
24938,-3,1,"I was very interested to hear about Central America and our process down there, and I thought for a moment that instead of a debate I was going to find Mr. Mondale in complete agreement with what we're doing, because the plan that he has outlined is the one we've been following for quite some time, including diplomatic processes throughout Central America and working closely with the Contadora group."
24940,-3,-1,"But if guilt is established, whoever is guilty we will treat with that situation then, and they will be removed."
24943,-3,-1,I'm afraid I misspoke when I said a CIA head in Nicaragua.
24944,-3,-1,There's not someone there directing all of this activity.
24946,-3,1,"And so it was a man down there in that area that this was delivered to, and he recognized that what was in that manual was in direct contravention of my own Executive order, in December of 1981, that we would have nothing to do with regard to political assassinations."
24948,-3,-1,What is a President charged with doing when he takes his oath of office?
24950,-3,-1,"A President can't know everything, but a President has to know those things that are essential to his leadership and the enforcement of our laws."
24955,-3,-1,A President must know these things.
24956,-3,-1,"I don't know which is worse, not knowing or knowing and not stopping it."
24963,-3,-1,"I never, ever conceived of such a thing."
24967,-3,-1,"How anyone could think that any sane person would believe you could call back a nuclear missile, I think is as ridiculous as the whole concept has been."
24968,-3,-1,"So, thank you for giving me a chance to straighten the record."
24969,-3,-1,I'm sure that you appreciate that.
24978,-3,-1,I have said on a number of occasions exactly what I believe about the Soviet Union.
24979,-3,-1,I retract nothing that I have said.
24980,-3,-1,I believe that many of the things they have done are evil in any concept of morality that we have.
24981,-3,-1,"But I also recognize that as the two great superpowers in the world, we have to live with each other."
24985,-3,-1,"But between us, we can either destroy the world or we can save it."
24986,-3,-1,"And I suggested that, certainly, it was to their common interest, along with ours, to avoid a conflict and to attempt to save the world and remove the nuclear weapons."
24987,-3,-1,And I think that perhaps we established a little better understanding.
24988,-3,-1,I think that in dealing with the Soviet Union one has to be realistic.
24995,-3,1,And now we are putting up a defense of our own.
24996,-3,-1,"And I've made it very plain to them, we seek no superiority."
24997,-3,-1,We simply are going to provide a deterrent so that it will be too costly for them if they are nursing any ideas of aggression against us.
24998,-3,1,"Now, they claim they're not."
24999,-3,-1,"And I made it plain to them, we're not."
25001,-3,-1,I just thought when I came into office it was time that there was some realistic talk to and about the Soviet Union.
25008,-3,-1,"Ah, well, now you've added a hypothetical there at the end, Mr. Kalb, about where we would send troops in to fight."
25011,-3,-1,Our neighbors here in America are vital to us.
25014,-3,-1,I believe that we have a great interest in the Pacific Basin.
25016,-3,-1,"But I am not going to pick out one and, in advance, hypothetically say, ""Oh, yes, we would send troops there.''"
25017,-3,-1,I don't want to send troops any place.
25028,-3,-1,I have no illusions about the Soviet Union leadership or the nature of that state.
25030,-3,-1,"Where I part with the President is that despite all of those differences we must, as past Presidents before this one have done, meet on the common ground of survival."
25032,-3,1,"And he now completes this term with no progress toward arms control at all, but with a very dangerous arms race underway instead."
25033,-3,1,"There are now over 2,000 more warheads pointed at us today than there were when he was sworn in, and that does not strengthen us."
25034,-3,-1,"We must be very, very realistic in the nature of that leadership, but we must grind away and talk to find ways of reducing these differences, particularly where arms races are concerned and other dangerous exercises of Soviet power."
25035,-3,-1,There will be no unilateral disarmament under my administration.
25036,-3,-1,I will keep this nation strong.
25037,-3,-1,"I understand exactly what the Soviets are up to, but that, too, is a part of national strength."
25038,-3,-1,"To do that, a President must know what is essential to command and to leadership and to strength."
25039,-3,-1,"And that's where the President's failure to master, in my opinion, the essential elements of arms control has cost us dearly."
25040,-3,0,He's 3 years into this administration.
25043,-3,1,"He said that these missiles were less dangerous than ballistic missiles because you could fire them, and you could recall them if you decided there'd been a miscalculation."
25045,-3,-1,A President must know those things.
25050,-3,-1,I think the essential strategy of the United States ought not accept any Soviet control over Eastern Europe.
25051,-3,-1,We ought to deal with each of these countries separately.
25053,-3,-1,"Where the Soviet Union has acted irresponsibly, as they have in many of those countries, especially, recently, in Poland, I believe we ought to insist that Western credits extended to the Soviet Union bear the market rate."
25054,-3,-1,Make the Soviets pay for their irresponsibility.
25055,-3,-1,That is a very important objective -- to make certain that we continue to look forward to progress toward greater independence by these nations and work with each of them separately.
25058,-3,-1,I'm not going to continue trying to respond to these repetitions of the falsehoods that have already been stated here.
25066,-3,1,"And he opposed even President Carter, when toward the end of his term President Carter wanted to increase the defense budget."
25068,-3,-1,"Mr. President, I accept your commitment to peace, but I want you to accept my commitment to a strong national defense."
25070,-3,-1,I'll tell you where we disagree.
25071,-3,1,"It is true over 10 years ago I voted to delay production of the F - 14, and I'll tell you why."
25073,-3,-1,Your definition of national strength is to throw money at the Defense Department.
25074,-3,-1,My definition of national strength is to make certain that a dollar spent buys us a dollar's worth of defense.
25075,-3,-1,There's a big difference between the two of us.
25077,-3,-1,"I will keep us strong, but you'll not do that unless you command that budget and make certain we get the strength that we need."
25086,-3,-1,"As a matter of fact, I believe every one of those standards is essential to the exercise of power by this country."
25087,-3,-1,And we can see that in both Lebanon and in Central America.
25088,-3,1,"In Lebanon, this President exercised American power, all right, but the management of it was such that our marines were killed, we had to leave in humiliation, the Soviet Union became stronger, terrorists became emboldened."
25089,-3,-1,"And it was because they did not think through how power should be exercised, did not have the American public with them on a plan that worked, that we ended up the way we did."
25092,-3,-1,And our enemies are strengthened from all of this.
25093,-3,-1,"We need to be strong, we need to be prepared to use that strength, but we must understand that we are a democracy."
25095,-3,-1,It is only in that way that we can persevere.
25108,-3,-1,"No, Morton, I don't agree to all of those things."
25110,-3,1,"But the first -- pardon me -- the first time we went in, we went in at their request because the war was going on right in Beirut between Israel and the PLO terrorists."
25111,-3,-1,Israel could not be blamed for that.
25113,-3,1,"Then we went in with the multinational force to help remove, and did remove, more than 13,000 of those terrorists from Lebanon."
25117,-3,0,We were there for the better part of a year.
25123,-3,1,"But we were succeeding to the point that the Lebanese Government had been organized -- if you will remember, there were the meetings in Geneva in which they began to meet with the hostile factional forces and try to put together some kind of a peace plan."
25125,-3,-1,"There are forces there -- and that includes Syria, in my mind -- who don't want us to succeed, who don't want that kind of a peace with a dominant Lebanon, dominant over its own territory."
25126,-3,1,"And so, the terrorist acts began and led to the one great tragedy when they were killed in that suicide bombing of the building."
25136,-3,1,"In a recent 30-day period, 37 terrorist acts in 20 countries have been committed."
25137,-3,0,The most recent has been the one in Brighton.
25139,-3,1,"I have just signed legislation to add to our ability to deal, along with our allies, with this terrorist problem."
25141,-3,-1,"Well, the red light went on."
25145,-3,-1,"-- me, or your own eyes?''"
25148,-3,1,"They went to him 5 days before they were killed and said, ""Please, take them out of there.''"
25156,-3,1,The President told the terrorists he was going to retaliate.
25162,-3,1,"First of all, Mr. Mondale should know that the President of the United States did not order the marines into that barracks."
25167,-3,-1,"We are going to, as I say, we're busy trying to find the centers where these operations stem from, and retaliation will be taken."
25168,-3,-1,"But we're not going to simply kill some people to say, ""Oh, look, we got even.''"
25169,-3,-1,We want to know when we retaliate that we're retaliating with those who are responsible for the terrorist acts.
25179,-3,-1,"Not at all, Mr. Trewhitt, and I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign."
25180,-3,-1,"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."
25184,-3,-1,"Mr. President, I'd like to head for the fence and try to catch that one before it goes over, but I'll go on to another question."
25188,-3,-1,"Secondly, if it is correct, have you informed yourself in the meantime?"
25189,-3,-1,"And third, is it even necessary for the President to be so intimately involved in strategic details?"
25193,-3,-1,"So, we thought that it would be simpler to negotiate first with those."
25195,-3,1,"The Soviet Union, to our surprise -- and not just mine -- made it plain when we brought this up that they placed, they thought, a greater reliance on the land-based missiles and, therefore, they wanted to take up all three."
25205,-3,-1,Should the President's age and stamina be an issue in the political campaign?
25208,-3,-1,"What's at issue here is the President's application of his authority to understand what a President must know to lead this nation, secure our defense, and make the decisions and the judgments that are necessary."
25209,-3,0,"A minute ago the President quoted Cicero, I believe."
25214,-3,1,"First, the Joint Chiefs of Staff went to the President, said, ""Don't put those troops there.''"
25216,-3,1,"And then 5 days before the troops were killed, they went back to the President, through the Secretary of Defense, and said, ""Please, Mr. President, take those troops out of there because we can't defend them.''"
25218,-3,-1,And we know what happened.
25219,-3,1,"After that, once again, our Embassy was exploded."
25225,-3,1,This is the first administration since the bomb went off that made no progress.
25226,-3,-1,We have an arms race underway instead.
25227,-3,-1,A President has to lead his government or it won't be done.
25228,-3,-1,Different people with different views fight with each other.
25229,-3,1,"For 31/2 years, this administration avoided arms control, resisted tabling arms control proposals that had any hope of agreeing, rebuked their negotiator in 1981 when he came close to an agreement, at least in principle, on medium-range weapons."
25234,-3,-1,But it takes more than that.
25235,-3,-1,You must be tough and smart.
25238,-3,-1,This question of leadership keeps arising in different forms in this discussion already.
25239,-3,1,"And the President, Mr. Mondale, has called you whining and vacillating, among the more charitable phrases -- weak, I believe."
25240,-3,-1,It is a question of leadership.
25242,-3,-1,Did you approve of his diplomatic activity?
25243,-3,-1,And are you prepared to repudiate him now?
25245,-3,-1,I don't admire Fidel Castro at all.
25251,-3,-1,And let's talk about people we do control.
25254,-3,-1,What does the President have to say about taking responsibility for a Vice President who won't apologize for something like that?
25259,-3,-1,"I know it'll come as a surprise to Mr. Mondale, but I am in charge."
25260,-3,1,"And, as a matter of fact, we haven't avoided arms control talks with the Soviet Union."
25261,-3,1,"Very early in my administration I proposed -- and I think something that had never been proposed by any previous administration -- I proposed a total elimination of intermediate-range missiles, where the Soviets had better than a 10 -- and still have -- better than a 10-to-1 advantage over the allies in Europe."
25263,-3,1,"The so-called negotiation that you said I walked out on was the so-called walk in the woods between one of our representatives and one of the Soviet Union, and it wasn't me that turned it down, the Soviet Union disavowed it."
25270,-3,-1,This is the kind of leadership that we've had in this administration on the most deadly issue of our times.
25283,-3,-1,"This is a very serious problem in our country, and it has to be dealt with."
25284,-3,-1,I object to that part of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill which I think is very unfair and would prove to be so.
25286,-3,-1,"I'm convinced that the result of this would be that people who are Hispanic, people who have different languages or speak with an accent, would find it difficult to be employed."
25291,-3,-1,"I have further strongly recommended that this administration do something it has not done, and that is to strengthen enforcement at the border, strengthen the officials in this government that deal with undocumented workers, and to do so in a way that's responsible and within the Constitution of the United States."
25292,-3,-1,"We need an answer to this problem, but it must be an American answer that is consistent with justice and due process."
25295,-3,-1,And one of those dreams is justice.
25296,-3,-1,And we need a measure -- and I will support a measure -- that brings about those objectives but avoids that one aspect that I think is very serious.
25298,-3,-1,We cannot solve this problem all on our own.
25305,-3,-1,"I'm doing it because all my life I've fought for a system of justice in this country, a system in which every American has a chance to achieve the fullness in life without discrimination."
25307,-3,-1,"And just inevitably, they're going to be reluctant to hire Hispanics or people with a different accent."
25309,-3,-1,"I am for reform in this area, for tough enforcement at the border, and for many other aspects of the Simpson-Mazzoli bill, but all my life I've fought for a fair nation."
25310,-3,-1,"And despite the politics of it, I stand where I stand, and I think I'm right, and before this fight is over we're going to come up with a better bill, a more effective bill that does not undermine the liberties of our people."
25315,-3,1,"Georgie Anne, we, believe me, supported the Simpson-Mazzoli bill strongly -- and the bill that came out of the Senate."
25316,-3,-1,"However, there were things added in in the House side that we felt made it less of a good bill; as a matter of fact, made it a bad bill."
25319,-3,-1,I can't go into detail about them here.
25320,-3,-1,But it is true our borders are out of control.
25321,-3,-1,It is also true that this has been a situation on our borders back through a number of administrations.
25323,-3,-1,I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.
25325,-3,-1,We don't think that those people should be allowed to continue operating free.
25326,-3,-1,"And this was why the provisions that we had in with regard to sanctions, and so forth -- and I'm going to do everything I can, and all of us in the administration are, to join in again when Congress is back at it to get an immigration bill that will give us, once again, control of our borders."
25328,-3,1,"But as long as they have an economy that leaves so many people in dire poverty and unemployment, they are going to seek that employment across our borders."
25340,-3,1,"And we have been the safety valve, whether we wanted to or not, with the illegal entry here, in Mexico, where their population is increasing and they don't have an economy that can absorb them and provide the jobs."
25344,-3,-1,"And if we're going to find a permanent, fundamental answer to this, it goes to American economic and trade policies that permit these nations to have a chance to get on their own two feet and to get prosperity, so that they can have jobs for themselves and their people."
25346,-3,1,"These high interest rates -- real rates that have doubled under this administration -- have had the same effect on Mexico and so on, and the cost of repaying those debts is so enormous that it results in massive unemployment, hardship, and heartache."
25350,-3,1,"But with regard to these high interest rates, too, at least give us the recognition of the fact that when you left office, Mr. Mondale, they were 211/2 -- the prime rate."
25351,-3,1,"It's now 121/4, and I predict it'll be coming down a little more shortly."
25352,-3,-1,"So, we're trying to undo some of the things that your administration did."
25363,-3,-1,"But no one knows whether Armageddon, those prophecies mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or day after tomorrow."
25369,-3,-1,"And if such a defense could be found, wouldn't it be far more humanitarian to say that now we can defend against a nuclear war by destroying missiles instead of slaughtering millions of people?"
25374,-3,-1,What if we did -- and I hope we can; we're still researching -- what if we come up with a weapon that renders those missiles obsolete?
25378,-3,-1,But why not do what I have offered to do and asked the Soviet Union to do?
25382,-3,-1,I think that would be the greatest use of a defensive weapon.
25385,-3,1,"First of all, let me sharply disagree with the President on sharing the most advanced, the most dangerous, the most important technology in America with the Soviet Union."
25388,-3,-1,"And the thought that we would share this with the Soviet Union is, in my opinion, a total non-STARTer."
25389,-3,-1,I would not let the Soviet Union get their hands on it at all.
25390,-3,-1,"Now, what's wrong with Star Wars?"
25391,-3,-1,There's nothing wrong with the theory of it.
25392,-3,-1,"If we could develop a principle that would say both sides could fire all their missiles and no one would get hurt, I suppose it's a good idea."
25393,-3,1,"But the fact of it is we're so far away from research that even comes close to that, that the Director of Engineering Research at the Defense Department said to get there we would have to solve eight problems, each of which are more difficult than the atomic bomb and the Manhattan project."
25395,-3,-1,The second thing is this all assumes that the Soviets wouldn't respond in kind.
25399,-3,-1,And that's been the tragic story of the arms race.
25400,-3,-1,We have more at stake in space satellites than they do.
25406,-3,-1,"It might be an oil fire, it might be a jet exhaust, the computer might decide it's a missile -- and off we go."
25414,-3,-1,I would not agree to any negotiations or any agreement that involved conduct on the part of the Soviet Union that we couldn't verify every day.
25415,-3,-1,I would not agree to any agreement in which the United States security interest was not fully recognized and supported.
25416,-3,-1,That's why we say mutual and verifiable freezes.
25417,-3,-1,"Now, why do I support the freeze?"
25420,-3,-1,It's putting a hair-trigger on nuclear war.
25422,-3,-1,"We have to be tough on the Soviet Union, but I think the American people -- --"
25424,-3,-1,-- -- and the people of the Soviet Union want it to stop.
25426,-3,-1,"Yes, my rebuttal, once again, is that this invention that has just been created here of how I would go about rolling over for the Soviet Union -- no, Mr. Mondale, my idea would be with that defensive weapon that we would sit down with them and then say, ""Now, are you willing to join us?"
25427,-3,-1,"Here's what we'' -- give them a demonstration and then say -- ""Here's what we can do."
25435,-3,-1,"I don't know what it would be, but if we can come up with one, I think the world will be better off."
25437,-3,-1,"Well, that's what a President's supposed to know -- where those weapons are going to be."
25438,-3,-1,"If they're space weapons, I assume they'll be in space."
25439,-3,-1,"[Laughter] If they're antisatellite weapons, I assume they're going to be aimed against satellites."
25440,-3,-1,"Now, this is the most dangerous technology that we possess."
25442,-3,-1,"And to give them technology of this kind, I disagree with."
25443,-3,-1,"You haven't just accepted research, Mr. President."
25444,-3,1,"You've set up a Strategic Defense Initiative, an agency, you're beginning to test, you're talking about deploying, you're asking for a budget of some $30 billion for this purpose."
25446,-3,-1,"And we will be better off, far better off, if we stop right now, because we have more to lose in space then they do."
25447,-3,-1,"If someday, somebody comes along with an answer, that's something else."
25448,-3,-1,But that there would be an answer in our lifetime is unimaginable.
25449,-3,-1,Why do we start things that we know the Soviets will match and make us all less secure?
25450,-3,-1,That's what a President's for.
25461,-3,-1,"It puts a hair-trigger, and it is a dangerous, destabilizing weapon."
25462,-3,1,"And the B - 1 is similarly to be opposed, because for 15 years the Soviet Union has been preparing to meet the B - 1."
25466,-3,-1,"In other words, a President has to make choices."
25468,-3,-1,The final point is that we can use this money that we save on these weapons to spend on things that we really need.
25470,-3,-1,"We need to strengthen that in order to assure our Western allies of our presence there, a strong defense, but also to diminish and reduce the likelihood of a commencement of a war and the use of nuclear weapons."
25480,-3,-1,"I will not agree to any arms control agreement, including a freeze, that's not verifiable."
25481,-3,-1,Let's take your warhead principle.
25485,-3,-1,"I will not agree to any production restrictions -- or agreements, unless we have the ability to verify those agreements."
25486,-3,-1,I don't trust the Russians.
25487,-3,-1,"I believe that every agreement we reach must be verifiable, and I will not agree to anything that we cannot tell every day."
25488,-3,-1,"In other words, we've got to be tough."
25489,-3,-1,"But in order to stop this arms madness, we've got to push ahead with tough negotiations that are verifiable so that we know the Soviets are agreeing and living up to their agreement."
25497,-3,-1,And I am not at all convinced that he was that far out of line with his people or that they wanted that to happen.
25498,-3,1,"The Shah had done our bidding and carried our load in the Middle East for quite some time, and I did think that it was a blot on our record that we let him down."
25502,-3,1,"The matter of Somoza -- no, I never defended Somoza."
25503,-3,1,"And, as a matter of fact, the previous administration stood by and so did I -- not that I could have done anything in my position at that time -- but for this revolution to take place."
25505,-3,1,"And then, just as Castro had done in Cuba, the Sandinistas ousted the other parties to the revolution."
25508,-3,1,And they installed a Marxist-Leninist totalitarian government.
25509,-3,1,"And what I have to say about this is, many times -- and this has to do with the Philippines, also, I know there are things there in the Philippines that do not look good to us from the standpoint right now of democratic rights, but what is the alternative?"
25510,-3,-1,It is a large Communist movement to take over the Philippines.
25512,-3,-1,"And I think that we've had enough of a record of letting -- under the guise of revolution -- someone that we thought was a little more right than we would be, letting that person go, and then winding up with totalitarianism, pure and simple, as the alternative."
25515,-3,-1,"Well, as I say, we have to look at what an overthrow there would mean and what the government would be that would follow."
25523,-3,1,"I went to the Philippines as Vice President, pressed for human rights, called for the release of Aquino, and made progress that had been stalled on both the Subic and the Clark airfield bases."
25526,-3,1,"What happens in South Africa, where, for example, the Nobel Prize winner, 2 days ago, said this administration is seen as working with the oppressive government of South Africa."
25528,-3,-1,We need to stand for human rights.
25529,-3,-1,We need to make it clear we're for human liberty.
25530,-3,-1,National security and human rights must go together.
25531,-3,-1,But this administration time and time again has lost its way in this field.
25535,-3,-1,I don't think that our record of human rights can be assailed.
25536,-3,-1,"I think that we have observed, ourselves, and have done our best to see that human rights are extended throughout the world."
25539,-3,-1,"Human rights are not advanced when, at the same time, you then stand back and say, ""Whoops, we didn't know the gun was loaded,'' and you have another totalitarian power on your hands."
25553,-3,-1,"But I think it's a very interesting proposal, to see if we can find, first of all, something that renders those weapons obsolete, incapable of their mission."
25554,-3,1,"But Mr. Mondale seems to approve MAD -- MAD is mutual assured destruction -- meaning, if you use nuclear weapons on us, the only thing we have to keep you from doing it is that we'll kill as many people of yours as you'll kill of ours."
25555,-3,-1,"I think that to do everything we can to find, as I say, something that would destroy weapons and not humans is a great step forward in human rights."
25559,-3,-1,"Do you believe in MAD, mutual assured destruction, mutual deterrence as it has been practiced for the last generation?"
25560,-3,-1,I believe in a sensible arms control approach that brings down these weapons to manageable levels.
25562,-3,-1,"And in the meantime, we have to be strong enough to make certain that the Soviet Union never tempts us."
25563,-3,-1,"Now, here we have to decide between generalized objectives and reality."
25565,-3,1,"But, in fact, these last 4 years have seen more weapons built, a wider and more vigorous arms race than in human history."
25568,-3,-1,But why start an arms race now?
25570,-3,-1,Why threaten our space satellites upon which we depend?
25571,-3,-1,Why pursue a strategy that would delegate to computers the question of starting a war?
25572,-3,-1,"A President, to defend this country and to get arms control, must master what's going on."
25573,-3,-1,I accept his objective and his dream; we all do.
25574,-3,-1,But the hard reality is that we must know what we're doing and pursue those objectives that are possible in our time.
25575,-3,1,"He's opposed every effort of every President to do so, and in the 4 years of his administration he's failed to do so."
25576,-3,-1,"And if you want a tough President who uses that strength to get arms control and draws the line in the heavens, vote for Walter Mondale."
25584,-3,0,This evening we talked about national strength.
25585,-3,-1,"I believe we need to be strong, and I will keep us strong."
25586,-3,-1,But I think strength must also require wisdom and smarts in its exercise.
25587,-3,-1,That's key to the strength of our nation.
25588,-3,-1,A President must know the essential facts essential to command.
25589,-3,-1,But a President must also have a vision of where this nation should go.
25590,-3,-1,"Tonight, as Americans, you have a choice."
25591,-3,-1,And you're entitled to know where we would take this country if you decide to elect us.
25592,-3,-1,"As President, I would press for long-term, vigorous economic growth."
25593,-3,-1,"That's why I want to get these debts down and these interest rates down, restore America's exports, help rural America, which is suffering so much, and bring the jobs back here for our children."
25594,-3,-1,"I want this next generation to be the best educated in American history, to invest in the human mind and science again, so we're out front."
25595,-3,-1,"I want this nation to protect its air, its water, its land, and its public health."
25596,-3,-1,America is not temporary; we're forever.
25598,-3,-1,"I want a nation of fairness, where no one is denied the fullness of life or discriminated against, and we deal compassionately with those in our midst who are in trouble."
25599,-3,-1,"And, above all, I want a nation that's strong."
25600,-3,1,"Since we debated 2 weeks ago, the United States and the Soviet Union have built a hundred more warheads, enough to kill millions of Americans and millions of Soviet citizens."
25605,-3,-1,"That lesson tells us two things: One, pick a President that you know will know if that tragic moment ever comes what he must know, because there'll be no time for staffing committees or advisers."
25606,-3,-1,A President must know right then.
25607,-3,-1,"But above all, pick a President who will fight to avoid the day when that God-awful decision ever needs to be made."
25609,-3,-1,America and Americans decide not just what's happening in this country.
25611,-3,-1,"When you make that judgment, you are deciding not only the future of our nation; in a very profound respect, you're deciding the future of the world."
25613,-3,-1,It's time for America to find new leadership.
25614,-3,-1,"Please, join me in this cause to move confidently and with a sense of assurance and command to build the blessed future of our nation."
25617,-3,-1,"My thanks to the League of Women Voters, to the panelists, the moderator, and to the people of Kansas City for their warm hospitality and greeting."
25619,-3,-1,"I am grateful for the chance to reaffirm my commitment to reduce nuclear weapons and, one day, to eliminate them entirely."
25621,-3,-1,"Or do we want to go forward, marching together, as a nation of strength and that's going to continue to be strong?"
25622,-3,-1,"We shouldn't be dwelling on the past, or even the present."
25623,-3,-1,The meaning of this election is the future and whether we're going to grow and provide the jobs and the opportunities for all Americans and that they need.
25625,-3,0,It was to go into a time capsule and would be read in 100 years when that time capsule was opened.
25627,-3,-1,My mind was full of what I was going to put in that letter about the problems and the issues that confront us in our time and what we did about them.
25629,-3,-1,"And I found myself wondering what it would be like for someone -- wondering if someone 100 years from now would be driving down that highway, and if they would see the same thing."
25631,-3,-1,I would be writing a letter to people who know everything there is to know about us.
25632,-3,0,We know nothing about them.
25636,-3,-1,"And then I thought to myself, what are they going to say about us, what are those people 100 years from now going to think?"
25638,-3,-1,"Well, what they will say about us 100 years from now depends on how we keep our rendezvous with destiny."
25639,-3,-1,"Will we do the things that we know must be done and know that one day, down in history 100 years or perhaps before, someone will say, ""Thank God for those people back in the 1980's for preserving our freedom, for saving for us this blessed planet called Earth, with all its grandeur and its beauty.''"
25642,-3,-1,We have met young America.
25647,-3,-1,I was just going to -- --
25683,-3,-1,I want to thank you and I want to thank everybody here tonight.
25684,-3,-1,"I want to give a special thanks to my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Robin for their love and support, and thank the people who are listening and watching all over America."
25688,-3,-1,You should know as much as possible about each of us.
25694,-3,0,"I got lots of relatives and they're good, average, middle-class, hardworking Americans."
25699,-3,-1,"Whether it's two parents working because one has to pay the taxes and one has to provide for the family, whether it's a single parent who just barely pays the pressing bills or whether you're worried about an education for your children going to the best schools, or whether you're worried about safe playgrounds, drug-free schools, crime-free schools."
25701,-3,-1,And hopefully tonight when we conclude this debate you will have a better understanding and the viewing and listening audience will have a better understanding.
25708,-3,-1,"What really matters is what happens to your future and what happens to our country as we stand on the brink of a new century, a time of extraordinary possibility."
25710,-3,1,"Compared to four years ago, we're clearly better off."
25712,-3,1,"Incomes are rising for the first time in a decade, the crime rates, the welfare rolls are falling, we're putting , 100,000 more police on the street."
25713,-3,1,"60,000 felons, fugitives and stalkers have been denied handguns."
25715,-3,-1,What we really should focus on tonight is what we still have to do to help the American people make the most of this future that's out there.
25718,-3,-1,To me that means we have to go on and balance this budget while we protect Medicare and Medicaid and education and the environment.
25719,-3,-1,"We should give a tax cut, targeted to child rearing and education, to buying a first home and paying for health care."
25744,-3,-1,"Well, I would say first of all, I think, it's a very good question."
25749,-3,0,"They see 900 FBI files, private person, being gathered up by somebody in the Whitehouse."
25754,-3,-1,"If you think the Republican party is some place for you to come if you're narrow minded or bigoted or don't like certain people in America, the exits are clearly marked for you to walk out of as I stand here without compromise, because this is the party of Lincoln."
25756,-3,0,I'm no longer a public official.
25763,-3,-1,"When I'm President of the United States, I will keep my word."
25770,-3,-1,"That's why I said tonight I'm for opportunity, responsibility and community."
25771,-3,-1,And we've gotten some real progress in the last four years.
25774,-3,0,You mentioned Washington and Lincoln.
25785,-3,1,We've raised about $10 million.
25789,-3,-1,So it seems to me that there's also a public trust.
25800,-3,-1,"First of all, let me say what we have done."
25804,-3,1,We have protected 25 million people through the passage of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that says you can use your health insurance if you change jobs or someone in your family has been sick.
25808,-3,-1,"Number one, add another million children to the insured ranks through the Medicaid program."
25811,-3,1,"That could protect 3 million families, 700,000 kids."
25812,-3,1,"Number four, make sure we protect the integrity with the Medicare program and Medicaid program and not do anything in cutting costs which would cause hundreds of hospitals to close which could have been the case if the 270billion dollar Medicare cut that I vetoed, had been enacted in the law."
25818,-3,1,You've said publicly that it's now three times the rate of inflation.
25819,-3,-1,We ought to cut the growth to twice the rate of inflation.
25821,-3,-1,So let's stop talking about cutting Medicare.
25824,-3,1,"17 new taxes, spend 1.5 trillion dollars, 50 new bureaucracies."
25831,-3,1,We still need to cover about 20million people and a lot of children.
25837,-3,-1,We need to help people who are between jobs.
25847,-3,1,"You know, we have 17,000 men and women today wearing our uniform that receive food stamps."
25848,-3,-1,It shouldn't happen in America.
25851,-3,-1,And it's time we take a look at the pay scales.
25852,-3,1,"Did get a 3 percent increase this year, but that's not enough."
25855,-3,-1,Every time you do that you take a risk.
25857,-3,-1,But I think anybody who wears a uniform is a great American.
25860,-3,-1,"That's all behind us now, and it should be behind us, and the forgotten war, the Korean War, but I guess I can just answer you very plainly, Jason."
25863,-3,-1,May I ask you a question?
25864,-3,-1,What service are you in?
25872,-3,-1,"So I, we're going to do better, and we'll do better still, but this is a commitment I think that all Americans share without regard to party."
25873,-3,-1,"I don't disagree with anything that the President said, except he waited four years to do these things, and my view is it ought to be, it will be done on Day 1."
25877,-3,1,We used to have 18.
25881,-3,1,We're down to 336 ships.
25883,-3,0,The President told you in '92 he would cut it 67 billion.
25885,-3,-1,But the last thing we ought to do is make those who wear the uniforms sacrifice.
25893,-3,1,"Now, on the Middle East, as you know, I worked very hard for peace in the Middle East."
25896,-3,-1,I can say this: I do not believe Yassir Arafat wants us to send troops to the West Bank.
25897,-3,1,We have never been asked to send troops to the West Bank.
25915,-3,1,"We're increasing defense reasonably -- not too much, but we are increasing defense some -- because we want to be prepared in case somebody here gets called up, Jason."
25919,-3,-1,But let's sort of keep this out of politics because it's pretty dicey right now.
25920,-3,1,"When the change of government occurred in Israel, the people of Israel were saying we don't want to abandon the peace process."
25941,-3,1,They may be danger -- I voted I for everything since that time.
25943,-3,1,"We sent it to the Clinton Administration for implementation, and they waited three and a half years."
25945,-3,-1,So you add it up.
25949,-3,0,I was asked a technical question.
25955,-3,-1,"You ought to be glad you quit, Oscar, 30 years."
25961,-3,-1,"When I'm President of the United States, we're going to use the National Guard and whatever sources we need to stop some of the drugs coming into America."
25965,-3,1,We did propose a regulation six months after I became President under the law he mentioned.
25979,-3,1,"Well, they also know if they live in San Diego, Mr. President, if you're caught with 125 pounds of marijuana or less, you go back to Mexico."
25988,-3,-1,"Once it's a drug, does it apply only to teenagers or everybody in America?"
25989,-3,-1,"Nobody should smoke, young or old, but particularly young people should not smoke, but my record is there."
26003,-3,-1,Let's talk about them separately.
26008,-3,-1,And we will do that.
26012,-3,1,I have proposed a budget which would put ten years on the life of the Medicare trust fund.
26016,-3,-1,"But now we can, we ought to pass this budget now and put ten years on it right away so no one has to worry about it."
26022,-3,0,They appointed a commission I was on that commission.
26028,-3,-1,"I think if I were a senior citizen I would be a little fed up with all these ads scaring seniors, scaring veterans and scaring students about education."
26030,-3,-1,We have ideas in the Dole-Kemp campaign and we will rescue Medicare as we did Social Security.
26031,-3,1,Their idea was to have the poorest seniors in the country pay $270 more this year.
26033,-3,1,Their idea was to charge everybody more out-of-pocket costs in their budget that I vetoed.
26034,-3,-1,"Not in an election year, sir."
26052,-3,0,"And I'm standing here as someone who, a long time ago as the county attorney in Russell, Kansas, one of our jobs every month was go through all the welfare checks and sign them."
26053,-3,0,And three of those checks were my grandparents'.
26059,-3,-1,"But at the same time, if you want to get off Medicare, get back in the mainstream, we're going to provide jobs."
26063,-3,1,"We provided more money for daycare in the bill that passed the senate, was vetoed, then it came back and the president signed pretty much the same bill."
26065,-3,-1,I don't think we ought to be giving welfare payments to illegal immigrants.
26067,-3,1,It puts a heavy burden on a states like California.
26068,-3,1,It costs California taxpayers 3 billion dollars a year.
26077,-3,-1,"Now, I've got a plan with this new welfare reform law to work with the private sector, to give employees specific tax incentives to hire people off welfare, and to do some other things which will create more jobs in the private sector, at least a million, and move more people from welfare to work."
26079,-3,-1,And I hope we get a chance to talk about this more.
26082,-3,0,I met that woman again.
26085,-3,0,"One's in technical school, one's an honor student in high school."
26087,-3,-1,Well another thing we can do.
26093,-3,-1,Reduce the capital gains rate.
26094,-3,-1,Create more jobs and opportunities for people on and off welfare.
26116,-3,-1,And these are things I think that will go a long way toward helping America build a stronger economy and a better tax system.
26118,-3,1,One of the big differences between Senator Dole and myself is that I told you how I'm going to pay for every penny of the tax cuts I recommend and we've worked hard to bring this deficit down and that's helped people in the real estate business because the interest rates are lower.
26125,-3,1,"Pam, what the president didn't tell you is all his tax cuts expire the year 2000, but these increases go on forever."
26127,-3,-1,"You know, give you a little tax cut, give you a couple of years, then make the tax increases go on forever."
26129,-3,1,"We have in the Dole-Kemp economic plan, unless unless your home's worth over 500,000 dollars."
26132,-3,-1,"It's a good idea, they saw it, they picked it up and put it in theirs, but it's only temporary."
26133,-3,-1,"Ours are permanent, ours is a good plan."
26135,-3,-1,"Capital gains rate, cut it in half, cut it 28 percent to 14 percent."
26137,-3,1,"If we cut the capital gains rate, I'm told everyday, I had a letter from a former constituent in Kansas saying I want to sell property in California, put it in my business in Kansas, I can't, because the capital gains rate's too high."
26141,-3,-1,That'll help people who want to get off welfare.
26144,-3,-1,We all assume that the tax cuts will be permanent.
26164,-3,0,"And I have a lot of young people work in my office, work in my campaign."
26168,-3,-1,I'm looking at our economic plan because I'm concerned about the future for young people.
26173,-3,1,"Rudy Giuliani, Mayor of New York, brought crime down 25 percent just in New York City."
26174,-3,-1,Of course the president will take credit for that.
26175,-3,-1,My view is we want to find jobs and opportunities and education.
26176,-3,1,"This year the Republican Congress, as far as student loans went from 24 billion to 36 billion over the next six years."
26180,-3,1,We also raised the amount of each Pell Grant.
26181,-3,1,"In our economic plan, the $500 child credit can be used for young people, rolled over and over and over, you, of course not this age, but if you have a child two years old, 7 percent interest would be worth about $18,000 by the time that child was ready for college."
26183,-3,-1,It's the age of his ideas that I question.
26187,-3,-1,Tell him you can have everything you got.
26193,-3,-1,My plan would give students a dollar-for-dollar reduction for the cost of a typical community college tuition.
26196,-3,-1,My whole administration is about your future.
26198,-3,-1,I hope you will look at the ideas in it.
26204,-3,-1,"That's what you like, you've got a perfect candidate."
26207,-3,-1,"Now all you got that tax cut, congratulations."
26209,-3,1,You got a 265 billion dollar tax increase.
26213,-3,-1,It will help you in whatever you're going to do in the next few years.
26226,-3,-1,Let me just give you some examples.
26233,-3,-1,"We weren't guaranteeing anything, anybody anything except the chance to prove they were qualified, the chance to prove that they could do it."
26234,-3,-1,And that's why I must say I agree with General Colin Powell that we're not there yet.
26235,-3,-1,"We ought to keep making those extra effort Affirmative Action programs, the law and the policy of the land."
26243,,1,People who got all the jobs were benefiting.
26245,-3,-1,It ought to be not based on gender or ethnicity or color.
26248,-3,-1,I shouldn't have a preference.
26250,-3,-1,Maybe we can work that out.
26251,-3,0,I get a 10-point spot.
26254,-3,-1,Discrimination ought to be punished but there ought to be equal opportunity.
26255,-3,-1,"We ought to reach out, make certain everybody has a chance to participate."
26258,-3,-1,That's not how America became the greatest country on the face of the earth.
26263,-3,-1,"Again I say, think of the Americans with Disabilities Act."
26266,-3,-1,You guarantee they have a chance to prove they're competent.
26276,-3,-1,Well I'm glad you asked.
26282,-3,-1,"Now, the President can say well he wants to mend it, not end it."
26283,-3,1,There are 168 federal programs that allow quotas.
26288,-3,-1,How do we pay for it?
26290,-3,0,He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote with him and lost by one vote.
26296,-3,-1,And you shouldn't have to apologize for wanting to keep all you can of it.
26297,-3,-1,But he ought to apologize for wanting to take more and more.
26299,-3,-1,"You know, one of the responsibilities of growing older, it seems to me, is being able to tell people something they may not want to hear just because it's true."
26304,-3,-1,Don't take my word for this.
26305,-3,1,"The Economist magazine polled lots of economists, seven Nobel prize winners who said if this tax scheme passes, it will require huge cuts, 40 percent, in the environment and law enforcement and education."
26308,-3,-1,"And it's paid for, and I'll tell you how I'll pay for it."
26314,-3,0,"You talked about it last time, you talked about a risky scheme and Vice President Gore repeated it about ten times in St. Petersburg."
26318,-3,-1,I'm going to keep my word to the American people.
26320,-3,-1,We're not going to touch Medicare.
26331,-3,0,"It was my very first bill, and I'm very proud of it because it symbolizes what I think we ought to be doing."
26333,-3,-1,Most important good things that happen in America happen in families.
26334,-3,0,"Just about every family I know, the main concern is how am I going to succeed at work and still do right by my children."
26337,-3,-1,I'd like to say you can also take a little time off without losing your job to go to a regular parent-teacher conference or to go to a regular doctor's appointment with a family member.
26338,-3,-1,"I'd also like to see the overtime laws change so that we could have some more flex time so that at the discretion of the worker, the worker, if you earn overtime, you could decide when you want that time to be taken, in cash or in time with your family if you've got a family problem."
26343,-3,-1,We have to help people succeed at home and at work.
26347,-3,-1,We had a better idea.
26351,-3,-1,"This is the way it ought to work, give more power back to the states and back to the people back to the taxpayers, not always the long arm of the federal government."
26358,-3,0,I spend a lot of time in hospitals.
26359,-3,-1,I know what it's like to be in a hospital.
26360,-3,-1,Sure we want family leave.
26361,-3,-1,But there's a better way to do it.
26363,-3,-1,I can't fix the statistics.
26366,-3,1,"The bill originally covered employers of 25 and more, but because of opposition, we went up to 50."
26370,-3,0,He said it would hurt the economy.
26372,-3,1,It didn't hurt the economy.
26392,-3,1,"You know, regulations cost the average family right here, Democrat or Republican, about $7,000 a year."
26396,-3,0,I met a lady in Colorado Springs about seven weeks ago now.
26401,-3,0,Congress passed a paperwork reduction act.
26404,-3,0,"You know, I fell off a platform out in California, Chico, a while back."
26407,-3,-1,We've got to stop some of these frivolous lawsuits.
26409,-3,-1,"Get the economy going, cut the capital gains rate, create more jobs and opportunities for everybody in America."
26411,-3,-1,And my word is good.
26413,-3,-1,"I don't break my promises after the election, and I don't make new promises in an election year."
26414,-3,-1,We're going to get it done.
26418,-3,1,We've gained manufacturing jobs since I've been President.
26419,-3,1,We've negotiated over 200 separate trade agreements.
26429,-3,1,Because we reduced the deficit four years in a row.
26438,-3,1,We had the worst economy in a century.
26440,-3,1,The president inherited growth of over 5 percent.
26441,-3,0,We don't have the S&L crisis anymore.
26455,-3,1,"In February he said we had the best economy in, 30 years, just February."
26458,-3,-1,I could answer a lot of these things tit for tat.
26463,-3,-1,"If you give me four years more I will work on it some more and I will try to answer these charges, but I prefer to emphasize direct answers to the future and I gave you a direct answer."
26465,-3,-1,"Well, I'm opposed to discrimination in any form but I don't favor creating special rights for any group."
26467,-3,-1,"And I'm, you know -- there would be special rights for different groups in America."
26469,-3,1,"I don't have any policy against hiring anyone; whether it's lifestyle or whatever, we don't have any policy of that kind, never have had in my office or will we have in the future."
26472,-3,-1,"But I will get back to the economic package because, again, I think this is very important."
26477,-3,1,"We had a 1.2 million bankruptcy, set a new record."
26478,-3,1,Credit card debt has never been higher.
26484,-3,1,"In San Diego where we had some defense cutbacks, we funded a project for the University of California San Diego to use airplane composite materials to build lighter, stronger bridges, a little project in a program that Senator Dole opposed."
26485,-3,1,And that composite now is going to be built around the bridges on the Santa Monica Freeway to help minimize the impact of earthquakes and create more jobs.
26503,-3,-1,And I think right now we got to go back.
26504,-3,-1,I know they've appointed a commission to take a look at managed care.
26506,-3,-1,"But it seems to me if we start to take choices away from people and if we drive them into one type care, eliminate fee-for-service altogether or eliminate the fact you can go to your own doctor, you have to go somewhere else, then I think we've taken a giant step backward in the United States of America."
26514,-3,-1,I hope not in both cases.
26515,-3,-1,But it does seem to me that you've raised a very important point that needs to be addressed.
26519,-3,-1,How many of you are under managed care plans?
26525,-3,-1,That's like the family of medical-leave law; it just tries to set the rules of the game.
26528,-3,-1,"If we're saving money and managing resources better, that's a good thing."
26529,-3,-1,"If we're saving money and depriving people of care, that's a bad thing."
26533,-3,-1,I think that would help.
26537,-3,-1,We'd have that trouble all over America.
26538,-3,-1,We need to deal with managed care.
26555,-3,-1,"Secondly, I think we need to look at making the elections more accessible."
26557,-3,-1,A lot of people are busy and it's hard for them to just get there and vote.
26574,-3,-1,But maybe there ought to be more debates.
26575,-3,-1,I would be willing to have another debate this year.
26583,-3,-1,One of the things I think that really frustrates people is that so often political campaigns seem to be more about the politicians that are running than the people.
26587,-3,-1,"If you vote the other way, you will be lucky to save it."
26588,-3,-1,But these are important questions.
26590,-3,-1,I think that the American people also need to be a little more responsible and think about whether there's a connection with their lives and what we do in Washington.
26604,-3,-1,It's something you might consider.
26615,-3,1,"Much, much less, but at least we fixed it for some time and 37 to 40 million people get their checks on time."
26617,-3,-1,And we need to make it stronger.
26618,-3,-1,"But we also need to look at some options, whether or not we -- depending on what the options are."
26619,-3,1,"In fact, they have got a commission right now in Congress, a bipartisan commission, looking at all the different options they will present to the next Congress."
26624,-3,-1,"So we've got to figure out how are we going to have more people with pension plans, and pension coverage has been declining as more and more people work for small businesses and fewer people work for big businesses."
26630,-3,-1,Did you say you're unemployed?
26637,-3,-1,Stop some of this senseless litigation and let people work in America.
26638,-3,-1,And I think that's that's the thrust we will make.
26639,-3,-1,"Obviously if Social Security is a very important program, it should -- it will be preserved."
26640,-3,-1,"Democrats or Republicans, it will be preserved."
26643,-3,-1,people get so tired of politics.
26644,-3,-1,We ought to do the same with Medicare.
26654,-3,-1,Let me tell you what we have done.
26655,-3,1,We have concluded with Japan 21 -- about to be 22 -- trade agreements now.
26658,-3,-1,"It's coming back now, so they can buy even more American products, and I think it will go down more."
26659,-3,-1,But I'm very -- that's one of the real success stories here of the work we've done.
26662,-3,1,"I visited a Jeep plant, oldest plant in America, a plant in Toledo, Ohio, where they're going to export 41,000 right hand drive Jeeps this year, and they've got 700 new jobs because of it."
26663,-3,1,There's no easy way to do this when you're dealing with an economy that's traditionally been more closed than one that's traditionally been more open.
26664,-3,-1,"You have to gut it out, issue by issue by issue."
26666,-3,-1,"We're the most competitive country in the world now, and then just fight to open those markets and go try to make the sale, and that's what our trade ambassador our commerce secretary and all the other people in our administration are trying to do."
26668,-3,1,"There are 357, 000 good jobs -- manufacturing jobs, which are lost."
26671,-3,-1,We ought to insist on access.
26672,-3,-1,"If we don't have access to their markets the same way they've access our markets, we ought to say, ""Wait, that's enough."
26674,-3,-1,"When you give us access, we'll give you access."""
26675,-3,-1,"It's very hard to get into the Japan market, as everybody knows."
26681,-3,-1,"Once you have a policy, then you have to go out and be aggressive and enforce that policy."
26686,-3,1,"Let me say again, we've had over 200 separate trade agreements in the last four years."
26689,-3,1,"We just had a pretty serious dispute with China because they were copying our CDs, and costing thousands of jobs in places like California."
26691,-3,-1,There is not a simple answer.
26703,-3,-1,You ought to make more decisions.
26704,-3,-1,"Honor, duty, and country, that's what America is all about."
26712,-3,1,"When you have 900 files gathered up by some guy who is a bouncer in a bar and hired a security officer to collect files, in Watergate -- I know a person who went to jail for looking at one file, one FBI file."
26719,-3,-1,"This is the most religious, great country in history."
26722,-3,-1,Let me very briefly give you some examples.
26727,-3,-1,"That is the kind of thing we have to do, give people like you and our families the power to give those values to our children."
26729,-3,-1,"Because it's God's will, whatever happens."
26733,-3,-1,"It seems to me the president, whoever the president may be, this is one of his highest responsibilities."
26747,-3,-1,"I want to answer your question, but let me say one other thing."
26749,-3,-1,"Now, I think I have to let Senator Dole speak for himself."
26759,-3,-1,"And one of the things I've tried hardest to do is to tell the American people that we have to get beyond that, we have to understand that we're stronger when we unite around shared values instead of being divided by our differences."
26763,-3,-1,You know we've suffered discrimination in the disability community.
26766,-3,-1,So we want to end discrimination.
26770,-3,-1,And I would just say that it seems to me that that's the way it ought to be.
26773,-3,-1,And we're all proud of it.
26774,-3,-1,But we're not there yet.
26787,-3,-1,"We need to be disagreeing on ideas, honestly, and talking about the future."
26788,-3,-1,The future will be the greatest time in this country's history if we can beat this division that is bedeviling the whole rest of the world.
26793,-3,-1,"Well, let me thank everybody here at the University and, Jim, thank you."
26809,-3,-1,"Somebody who understands that there're real Americans out there with real problems, whether soccer moms, or the single parents, the families or the seniors, or people with disabilities, whoever it may be."
26819,-3,0,I will just say my time is running out here.
26822,-3,-1,And I want them to be proud of their vote in the years ahead.
26824,-3,-1,Proud that they voted hopefully for me.
26828,-3,-1,I promise you the economy is going to get better.
26830,-3,-1,We're going into the next century a better America.
26833,-3,-1,"And thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and all the people who are watching."
26839,-3,-1,"Would we be better off as I believe, working together to give each other the tools we need to make the most of our God-given potential, or are we better off saying, you're on your own?"
26840,-3,-1,Would we be better off building that bridge to the future together so we can all walk across it or saying you can get across yourself?
26841,-3,-1,"If you don't agree -- leave this room with anything else tonight and if the people watching us don't leave with anything else, I hope you will leave with this."
26844,-3,-1,And the decisions we make will have enormous practical consequences.
26849,-3,-1,"You will decide whether we're going to keep fighting crime with a Brady Bill, assault weapons and finish putting those 100,000 police."
26850,-3,-1,Whether we're going to move a million people from welfare to work.
26853,-3,-1,Where every eight-year-old can read.
26856,-3,-1,If we do those things we will build that bridge to the 21st Century and the greatest country in history will be even greater.
26904,-3,-1,"And Mr. President, it's good to be with you again."
26910,-3,1,"Of course we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there."
26922,-3,1,"This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries, and it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America, long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism."
26930,-3,1,"Now with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, that we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harm's way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened, and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice."
26934,-3,1,"Got rid of a despot who had killed Americans and as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans after the events in Benghazi marching and saying America is our friend."
26936,-3,-1,Now that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.
26942,-3,-1,"We don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan."
26945,-3,-1,And how do we do that?
26953,-3,-1,We have to help these nations create civil societies.
26954,-3,1,"But what's been happening over the last couple of years is, as we've watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see Al Qaida rushing in, you see other jihadist groups rushing in."
26958,-3,1,"Libya's 6 million population; Egypt, 80 million population."
26961,-3,1,"And, of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon, we've got real (inaudible)."
26969,-3,1,You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.
26970,-3,1,"You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it."
26974,-3,-1,"So, what -- what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map."
26987,-3,1,"It's a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same -- in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face."
26990,-3,-1,"I'm not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia, or Mr. Putin."
26993,-3,0,"Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed I believe that there should be a status of forces agreement."
26999,-3,1,"I'm sorry, you actually -- there was a -- there was an effort on the part of the president to have a status of forces agreement, and I concurred in that, and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on."
27006,-3,1,"You thought it should have been 5,000 troops..."
27011,-3,-1,The answer was we got...
27013,-3,1,... no troops through whatsoever.
27035,-3,1,You just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq.
27057,-3,1,"What we've done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go."
27061,-3,-1,"But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future."
27063,-3,-1,"This -- what we're seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking, and that's why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition."
27066,-3,1,"But what we can't do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term."
27075,-3,-1,"Number two, seeing a -- a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us."
27076,-3,1,"And finally, we don't want to have military involvement there."
27085,-3,-1,"We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the -- the insurgent there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed, are people who will be the responsible parties."
27097,-3,-1,We are playing the leadership role.
27101,-3,-1,But going back to Libya -- because this is an example of how we make choices.
27102,-3,1,"When we went in to Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there, because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize."
27111,-3,-1,That's exactly what we're doing.
27118,-3,-1,But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our -- of our troops.
27120,-3,-1,And this isn't -- this isn't going to be necessary.
27122,-3,1,"But look, this has been going on for a year."
27129,-3,-1,America can help that happen.
27142,-3,-1,"No, I don't, because I think that America has to stand with democracy."
27146,-3,-1,These countries can't develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need.
27151,-3,-1,Their aspirations are similar to young people's here.
27156,-3,0,"You know, one of the challenges over the last decade is we've done experiments in nation building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan and we've neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system."
27160,-3,0,"I believe, as the president indicated, and said at the time that I supported his -- his action there."
27165,-3,-1,We want a peaceful planet.
27166,-3,-1,"We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know they're going to have a bright and prosperous future, not be at war."
27172,-3,-1,And that begins with a strong economy here at home.
27176,-3,1,This -- we have weakened our economy.
27178,-3,-1,We need to have as well a strong military.
27184,-3,1,"We're the great nation that has allies, 42 allies and friends around the world."
27188,-3,1,"But unfortunately, in -- nowhere in the world is America's influence greater today than it was four years ago."
27195,-3,-1,"Well I -- I absolutely believe that America has a -- a responsibility, and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that -- that make the world more peaceful."
27199,-3,-1,So we want to promote those principles around the world.
27202,-3,-1,"But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong."
27208,-3,-1,We have to get our economy going.
27209,-3,-1,"And our military, we've got to strengthen our military long-term."
27210,-3,-1,We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road.
27215,-3,-1,I will not cut our military budget.
27219,-3,0,"And then, of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when -- when the students took to the streets in Tehran and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred, for the president to be silent I thought was an enormous mistake."
27226,-3,1,"And Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger, in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat."
27227,-3,1,"But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America, and that's what my plan does."
27228,-3,1,"Making sure that we're bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that we're creating jobs here, as we've done with the auto industry, not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas."
27231,-3,1,We've cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because we've developed oil and natural gas.
27234,-3,-1,And we've got to make sure that we reduce our deficit.
27236,-3,-1,"We've got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we don't need, but also asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more."
27237,-3,-1,That way we can invest in the research and technology that's always kept us at the cutting edge.
27238,-3,0,"Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign."
27240,-3,0,He's praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who's -- who shows great wisdom and judgment.
27252,-3,1,Trade grows about 12 percent year.
27256,-3,1,"As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China."
27263,-3,-1,And I'll get us on track to a balanced budget.
27269,-3,-1,"Well, let's talk about what we need to compete."
27276,-3,0,We didn't have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.
27294,-3,-1,"... if you'll let me, Bob, just about education..."
27296,-3,-1,... because I'm -- I'm so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.
27298,-3,0,Fourth graders and eighth graders are tested in English and math.
27300,-3,1,And our eighth graders number one in English and also in math.
27308,-3,1,And then you cut education spending when you came into office.
27324,-3,-1,"Well, let's come back and talk about the military, but all the way -- all the way through."
27330,-3,-1,I'd be happy to have you take a look.
27332,-3,-1,You look at how we get to a balanced budget within eight to 10 years.
27337,-3,-1,So I'd get rid of that one from day one.
27338,-3,-1,"To the extent humanly possible, we get that out."
27340,-3,1,"Number two, we take some programs that we are doing to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor; we'll take that healthcare program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently."
27353,-3,1,"Now, keep in mind that our military spending has gone up every single year that I've been in office."
27354,-3,1,"We spend more on our military than the next 10 countries combined; China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, you name it."
27356,-3,-1,"And what I did was work with our joint chiefs of staff to think about, what are we going to need in the future to make sure that we are safe?"
27358,-3,1,"But, what you can't do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for, $5 trillion on tax cuts."
27361,-3,1,The math simply doesn't work.
27362,-3,-1,"But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not, you know just budgets, we've got to think about capabilities."
27363,-3,-1,We need to be thinking about cyber security.
27365,-3,-1,"That's exactly what our budget does, but it's driven by strategy."
27369,-3,1,"That's exactly what our budget does, and it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern."
27371,-3,0,I'm pleased that I've balanced budgets.
27372,-3,0,I was on the world of business for 25 years.
27378,-3,1,The president hasn't balanced a budget yet.
27379,-3,-1,I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.
27408,-3,-1,"And so the question is not a game of Battleship, where we're counting slips."
27409,-3,-1,It's what are our capabilities.
27420,-3,1,"First of all, Israel is a true friend."
27426,-3,-1,I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.
27427,-3,1,"And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history."
27429,-3,1,"But to the issue of Iran, as long as I'm president of the United States Iran will not get a nuclear weapon."
27431,-3,1,"We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy."
27439,-3,1,And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map.
27443,-3,-1,"I think that would be a mistake, because when I've sent young men and women into harm's way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort."
27451,-3,1,"And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago, when I was in Israel, speaking at the Herzliya Conference."
27456,-3,-1,I would have put them in place earlier.
27457,-3,-1,But it's good that we have them.
27463,-3,-1,I would tighten those sanctions further.
27469,-3,-1,The same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.
27470,-3,-1,"We need to increase pressure time, and time again on Iran because anything other than a -- a -- a solution to this, which says -- which stops this -- this nuclear folly of theirs, is unacceptable to America."
27471,-3,-1,"And of course, a military action is the last resort."
27478,-3,-1,But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.
27484,-3,-1,"You know, there have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that -- that would make a difference."
27507,-3,1,"And I say that because from the very beginning, the president in his campaign four years ago, said he would meet with all the world's worst actors in his first year, he'd sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and President Ahmadinejad of Iran."
27510,-3,-1,I think they looked at that and saw weakness.
27516,-3,-1,"That's unacceptable for us, and it's essential for a president to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable."
27518,-3,-1,They must not develop nuclear capability.
27523,-3,-1,"We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we won't have to take the military action."
27530,-3,-1,"So I'll let the American people decide, judge, who's going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions."
27538,-3,1,We're four years closer to a nuclear Iran.
27548,-3,1,We have freed other nations from dictators.
27549,-3,-1,"Bob, let me -- let me respond."
27551,-3,1,"And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors."
27558,-3,0,"So that's how I've used my travels, when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the region."
27561,-3,-1,And they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.
27566,-3,-1,"Bob, let's not go into hypotheticals of that nature."
27579,-3,1,"I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead, Assad still in power."
27580,-3,1,"I see our trade deficit with China, larger than it's -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact."
27582,-3,1,They're back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.
27590,-3,-1,"I mean, I'm -- I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program."
27597,-3,-1,And you said we should ask Pakistan for permission.
27599,-3,-1,And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him.
27602,-3,-1,"And for the next decade, she was haunted by that conversation."
27603,-3,0,"And she said to me, ""You know, by finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me."""
27613,-3,-1,You can't -- but you can't have the president just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond.
27623,-3,-1,The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so.
27624,-3,1,We've seen progress over the past several years.
27627,-3,1,So our troops will come home at that point.
27635,-3,-1,And so we're going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild the relationship with us.
27639,-3,1,"When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade."
27647,-3,1,"And we're now in a position where we can transition out, because there's no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country."
27655,-3,1,The first lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces putting our veterans back to work.
27670,-3,-1,This is -- this is an important part of the world for us.
27674,-3,-1,We -- we had to go into Pakistan.
27676,-3,-1,That was the right thing to do.
27690,-3,-1,"But let me also note that as I said earlier, we're going to have to do more than just going after leaders and -- and killing bad guys, important as that is."
27691,-3,1,We're also going to have to have a farm more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.
27693,-3,-1,"We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the -- the record, you look at the record."
27702,-3,-1,"We have not seen the progress we need to have, and I'm convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands."
27704,-3,1,"We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan."
27705,-3,1,"And what we've also done is engaged these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in people's lives day to day, to make sure that their governments aren't corrupt, to make sure that they're treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown and to make sure that they've got a free market system that works."
27706,-3,-1,"So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries."
27708,-3,1,"One thing I think Americans should be proud of, when Tunisians began to protest, this nation -- me, my administration -- stood with them earlier than just about any country."
27721,-3,-1,"Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks."
27727,-3,1,That's the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other -- the previous administration had done in two terms.
27731,-3,1,And we put a stop to it and as a consequence saved jobs throughout America.
27733,-3,-1,"But I tell you, those workers don't feel that way."
27734,-3,-1,They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously.
27736,-3,1,"If we don't have the best education system in the world, if we don't continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, that's how we lose the competition."
27741,-3,1,It's not government investments that makes businesses grow and hire people.
27750,-3,-1,"We don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form."
27758,-3,1,The secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.
27759,-3,1,"It's not my term, it's the president's own secretary of defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating."
27762,-3,-1,"And the answer is, yes, if I'm president, America will be very strong."
27763,-3,-1,We'll also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us.
27770,-3,1,"They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods."
27773,-3,-1,"We like free enterprise, but you got to play by the rules."
27782,-3,1,"We have enormous trade imbalance with China, and it's worse this year than last year, and it's worse last year than the year before."
27783,-3,-1,And so we have to understand that we can't just surrender and lose jobs year in and year out.
27786,-3,-1,But this can't keep on going.
27787,-3,-1,"You can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States."
27788,-3,0,"I was with one company that makes valves and -- and process industries and they said, look, we were -- we were having some valves coming in that -- that were broken and we had to repair them under warranty and we looked them and -- and they had our serial number on them."
27789,-3,0,And then we noticed that there was more than one with that same serial number.
27790,-3,1,"They were counterfeit products being made overseas with the same serial number as a U.S. company, the same packaging, these were being sold into our market and around the world as if they were made by the U.S. competitor."
27797,-3,-1,But I've made a different bet on American workers.
27800,-3,1,"Now that's estimated to create 800,000 jobs, the problem is they won't be here, they'll be in places like China."
27801,-3,1,"And if we're not making investments in education and basic research, which is not something that the private sector is doing at a sufficient pace right now and has never done, then we will lose the (inaudible) in things like clean energy technology."
27802,-3,1,"Now with respect to what we've done with China already, U.S. exports have doubled since I came into office, to China and actually currencies are at their most advantageous point for U.S. exporters since 1993."
27806,-3,0,"We are working with countries in the region to make sure, for example, that ships can pass through; that commerce continues."
27809,-3,-1,That's the kind of leadership that we'll continue to show.
27811,-3,1,But the president mentioned the auto industry and that somehow I would be in favor of jobs being elsewhere.
27812,-3,-1,Nothing could be further from the truth.
27813,-3,0,I'm a son of Detroit.
27822,-3,1,"And in that process, they can get government help and government guarantees, but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they'd -- they'd built up."
27827,-3,-1,"Governor Romney, you did not..."
27832,-3,-1,Under no circumstances would I do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet.
27833,-3,-1,"And the idea that has been suggested that I would liquidate the industry, of course not."
27838,-3,-1,That's the height of silliness...
27840,-3,-1,Let -- let -- let's...
27850,-3,-1,...and -- and that's why I have the kind of commitment to ensure that our industries in this country can compete and be successful.
27851,-3,-1,"We in this country can -- can compete successfully with anyone in the world, and we're going to."
27856,-3,-1,I -- I want to invest in research.
27863,-3,-1,That's the wrong way to go.
27874,-3,-1,...because the private sector's not going to invest in a...
27888,-3,-1,"Governor Romney, you keep on trying to, you know airbrush history here."
27889,-3,1,"You were very clear that you would not provide, government assistance to the U.S. auto companies, even if they went through bankruptcy."
27890,-3,0,You said that they could get it in the private marketplace.
27904,-3,-1,People will look it up.
27909,-3,-1,"Cutting our investments in research and technology, that's not a smart choice."
27910,-3,1,That will not help us compete with China.
27917,-3,-1,"I couldn't agree more about going forward, but I certainly don't want to go back to the policies of the last four years."
27919,-3,1,Twenty-three million Americans still struggling to find a good job.
27920,-3,1,When you came to office 32 million people on food stamps.
27925,-3,1,We're 9 million jobs short of that.
27926,-3,0,I've met some of those people.
27927,-3,0,"I've met them in Appleton, Wisconsin."
27928,-3,1,"I met a young woman in -- in Philadelphia who's coming out of -- out of college, can't find work."
27937,-3,1,The federal government didn't hire our teachers.
27940,-3,-1,But I want to get our private sector growing and I know how to do it.
27947,-3,-1,"Well, thank you very much, Bob, Governor Romney, and to Lynn University."
27950,-3,1,"Over the last four years we've made real progress digging our way out of policies that gave us two prolonged wars, record deficits and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression."
27952,-3,-1,And I've got a different vision for America.
27954,-3,1,"And I've put forward a plan to make sure that we're bringing manufacturing jobs back to our shores by rewarding companies and small businesses that are investing here, not overseas."
27957,-3,-1,I want to control our own energy by developing oil and natural gas but also the energy sources of the future.
27968,-3,-1,I'm excited about our prospects as a nation.
27973,-3,-1,America's going to have that kind of leadership and continue to promote principles of peace to make a world a safer place and make people in this country more confident that their future is secure.
27976,-3,1,"One is a path represented by the president, which at the end of four years would mean we'd have $20 trillion in debt heading towards Greece."
27980,-3,1,The president's path will mean continuing declining in take-home pay.
27981,-3,-1,I want to make sure take-home pay turns around and starts to grow.
27982,-3,1,The president's path means 20 million people out of work struggling for a good job.
27984,-3,-1,"I'm going to make sure that we get people off of food stamps, not by cutting the program, but by getting them good jobs."
27990,-3,-1,"I know what it takes to get this country back, and will work with good Democrats and good Republicans to do that."
27993,-3,-1,They've held a torch for the world to see -- the torch of freedom and hope and opportunity.
27994,-3,-1,"Now, it's our turn to take that torch."
27997,-3,-1,I'd like to be that leader with your support.
28041,-3,1,This state became one of the top five in the nation for health care coverage for children under his leadership.
28044,-3,-1,"Now, Mr. Hankins, I think that the situation that you describe has gotten completely out of hand."
28065,-3,1,"It says if you've got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body."
28093,-3,-1,What about the Dingle-Norwood bill?
28100,-3,-1,"It's kind of Washington, D.C. focus."
28113,-3,-1,It's kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue.
28116,-3,-1,That's part of an overall overhaul.
28128,-3,-1,"All right, here we go again."
28131,-3,-1,And you asked a great question because it's not only seniors.
28148,-3,1,"If you have extraordinarily high cost, then they pay all over $4,000 out-of-pocket."
28159,-3,-1,"I think that we should move step-by-step toward universal health coverage, but I am not in favor of government doing it all."
28163,-3,-1,"We have got to get health coverage for those who do not have it and we've got to improve the quality for those who do with a patient's bill of rights that's real and that works, the Dingle-Norwood bill, and we have got to fill in the gaps in coverage by finally bringing parity for the treatment of mental illness, because that's been left out."
28164,-3,-1,We have got to deal with long-term care.
28186,-3,-1,I don't want the federal government making decisions on behalf of everybody.
28193,-3,-1,"The question is, are people getting health care, and we have a strong safety net, and there needs to be a safety net in America."
28205,-3,-1,And that's what we ought to do for all people in America.
28217,-3,-1,"Well, you know, it's hard to make people love one another."
28223,-3,-1,I recognize there are some who just don't seem to care.
28233,-3,-1,I think parents will be more involved with education when they know their children's classrooms are safe and secure as well.
28241,-3,-1,I'd like to start by telling you what my vision is.
28247,-3,-1,"We need to give teachers the training and professional development that they need, including a paid time off to go visit the classroom of a master teacher to pick up some new skills."
28248,-3,-1,"I want to give every middle-class family a $10,000 a year tax deduction for college tuition so that middle-class families will always be able to send their kids on to college."
28258,-3,-1,"I think any time we end with one of these attacks, it's appropriate to respond."
28271,-3,1,"And the consequence is that federal portion or federal money will go to the parent, so the parent can go to a tutoring program or another public school or another private school."
28276,-3,1,"Well, the program that he's proposing is not the one that he just described."
28277,-3,1,"Described under your plan, Governor Bush, states would be required to pay vouchers to students to match the vouchers so that the federal government would put up."
28282,-3,-1,"If I thought that there was no alternative, then I might feel differently."
28291,-3,-1,What grade do you teach?
28309,-3,-1,"It requires testing of all new teachers, including in the subjects that they teach."
28312,-3,1,"When you total up all the federal spending he wants to do, it's the largest increase in federal spending in years."
28314,-3,0,"I have been a governor of a big state, I have made education my number one priority."
28316,-3,-1,They ought to say this is the most important thing we do as a state.
28322,-3,-1,I worry about federalizing education if I were you.
28327,-3,-1,I believe strongly in a teacher protection act like I mentioned.
28340,-3,1,"Look, the problem is that under Governor Bush's plan, $1.6 trillion tax cut, mostly to the wealthy, under his own budget numbers, he proposes spending more money for a tax cut just for the wealthiest 1% than all the new money he budgets for education, health care and national defense combined."
28341,-3,-1,Now under my plan we'll balance the budget every year.
28344,-3,1,"I have helped to balance the budget for the first time in 30 years, paid down the debt."
28367,-3,-1,"If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief."
28372,-3,1,But the top 1% will end up paying one-third of the taxes in America and they get one-fifth of the benefits.
28378,-3,-1,It's a difference of opinion.
28388,-3,1,People who pay taxes will get tax relief.
28396,-3,-1,Because the tax code is unfair for people at the bottom end of the economic ladder.
28413,-3,-1,Now you judge for yourselves whether or not that's fair.
28422,-3,-1,"In eight years they haven't gotten anything done on Medicare, on Social Security, a patient's bill of rights."
28441,-3,-1,Our nation needs to be credible and strong.
28446,-3,-1,We can't put the Middle East peace process on our timetable.
28453,-3,-1,Saddam Hussein still is a threat in the Middle East.
28457,-3,-1,"So to answer your question, it requires a clear vision, a willingness to stand by our friends, and the credibility for people both friend and foe to understand when America says something, we mean it."
28461,-3,-1,We stand for those values and we have to be willing to assert them.
28463,-3,-1,I will -- I pledge to you I will do whatever is necessary to make sure that it stays that way.
28469,-3,1,"In the Congress, in the House of Representatives, I served on the House Intelligence Committee and I worked hard to learn the subject of nuclear arms control and how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non-proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new weapons of mass destruction."
28495,-3,-1,I also support modernization of our strategic and tactical weaponry.
28514,-3,-1,And the exit strategy needs to be well-defined.
28549,-3,-1,I believe that we ought to keep guns out of the hands of people that shouldn't have them.
28584,-3,-1,"Now, my plan for the future, I see a time when we have smaller, smarter government where you don't have to wait in line because you can get services online cheaper, better, faster."
28603,-3,-1,"And I think that you pointed the way in your comments, because when you say there are multiple things accomplished by farmers, you're specifically including conservation and protection of the environment."
28606,-3,-1,I think that we ought to have an expanded conservation reserve program.
28618,-3,-1,I don't want to use food as a diplomatic weapon from this point forward.
28623,-3,-1,We need more work on value-added processing.
28628,-3,-1,"I'm for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax."
28629,-3,1,One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax.
28649,-3,1,So 80% -- now the problem with completely eliminating it goes back to the wealthiest 1%.
28696,-3,-1,"Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because we're free."
28706,-3,-1,"It's not just movies; television, video games, music, the Internet."
28718,-3,1,"And recently the Federal Trade Commission pointed out that some of these entertainment companies have warned parents that the material is inappropriate for children, and then they've turned around behind the backs of the parents and advertised that same adult material directly to children."
28737,-3,-1,"Sometimes people who are very idealistic and have great dreams, as young people do, are apt to stay at arm's length from the political process because they think their good hearts might be brittle, and if they invest their hopes and allow themselves to believe, then they're gonna be let down and disappointed."
28747,-3,-1,"Because I think that the special interests have too much power, and we need to give our democracy back to the American people."
28753,-3,-1,"They ought to have their voices heard, but they shouldn't have a big megaphone that drowns out the American people."
28767,-3,-1,I think it's the tone.
28803,-3,-1,It was a smart thing to do.
28813,-3,-1,I believe in this goal and effort with all my heart.
28818,-3,-1,"It's all too easy for somebody in the majority in the population to say oh, we're just all the same, without an understanding of the different life experience that you've had, that others have had."
28836,-3,-1,They're against the American way.
28849,-3,-1,Are you for what the Supreme Court says is a constitutional way of having affirmative action?
28857,-3,1,"If you make less than $60,000 a year and you decide to invest $1,000 in a savings account, you'll get a tax credit, which means in essence that the federal government will match your $1,000 with another $1,000."
28860,-3,1,"You'll get an access to life-long learning and education, help with tuition if you want to get a new skill or training."
28879,-3,-1,You're going to live in a peaceful world.
28913,-3,-1,And did the person have full access to the courts of law?
28917,-3,-1,I'm proud of the fact that we hold people accountable.
28934,-3,-1,I think the reason to support the death penalty is because it saves other people's lives.
28935,-3,-1,I think it is a deterrent.
28948,-3,1,"22 million new jobs, very low unemployment nationally."
28950,-3,-1,Here are some promises that I'll make to you now.
28953,-3,-1,"I will give middle-class Americans tax cuts, meaningful ones."
28964,-3,-1,Thank you for your question.
28970,-3,-1,There's too much bitterness in Washington.
29003,-3,-1,"And the governor may not want to answer that question, he may want to call it a high school debating trick, but let me tell you this."
29008,-3,-1,"If you take a trillion dollars out of that Social Security Trust Fund, how are the checks going to be -- how are you going to keep faith with the seniors?"
29029,-3,-1,I kept the faith with my family.
29040,-3,1,Lower crime rates for eight years in a row.
29047,-3,-1,I think after three debates the good people of this country understand there is a difference of opinion.
29049,-3,-1,I've got an agenda that I want to get done for the country.
29051,-3,-1,"It's an agenda that says we're listen to the young voices in Social Security and say we're going to think differently about making sure we have a system, but also fulfill the promise to the seniors in America."
29054,-3,-1,I want to make sure the public school system in America keeps its promise so not one child is left behind.
29057,-3,-1,I think it's the people's money.
29064,-3,-1,"(LAUGHTER) But for those who have not made up their mind, I would like to conclude by this promise."
